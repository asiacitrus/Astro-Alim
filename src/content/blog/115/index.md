 Alhamdolillah (Praise be to Allah, the Supreme God), Muslims are observing the 2020 Holy month of Ramadan (fasting) across the world. Last ten days of Ramadan are extremely important. One night of these ten days is the night when Al-Quran, the last Holy Book of Allah, the Exalted was sent down through the archangel Jibril (Gabriel) to the last Prophet, Mohammad, peace and blessings of Allah be upon him (pbuh). This specific night is entitled Lailat al-Qadr by Allah, the Most Powerful Himself. The Muslims know this night as “Nuzul ul Quran” night as well. He, the Noble Lord declared in the Quran:{{< arabic class="arabic_text_style" dir="rtl" >}} اِنَّا اَنْزَلْنَاهُ فِي لَيْلَةِ القَدْر . {{< /arabic >}} “We have revealed (Quran) in the night of power.” (Al-Qadr, 97:1) In another verse Allah, Subhanahu wa Taala (SWT) says in more specific terms: :{{< arabic class="arabic_text_style" dir="rtl" >}} شَهْرُ رَمْضَانَ الَّذِيْ اُنْزِلَ فِيْهِ الْقُرْانْ  {{< /arabic >}} “Ramadan is the month in which Quran was revealed” (Al-Baqara, 2:185). Clearly it is the month of Ramadan night when the Quran Revelation started. The actual date for the first revelation was calculated as Friday, the 17th day of Ramadan in 610 AD. This day this year is on May 10, 2020.

The {{< arabic class="arabic_text_style" dir="rtl" >}}  نُزوْلُ  القُرْان  {{< /arabic >}} (Nuzul ul-Quran) or the Night of Power is celebrated each year during last ten days of Ramadan. The Muslims learn significance of Nuzul ul-Quran; the life of the Prophet Mohammed (pbuh); al-Quran, the guidance sent by Allah SWT; then thank Allah, SWT by observing extra prayers during this night, and seeking Allah’s help for the successes of this worldly life and the Life Hereafter. 

Prior to receiving the first revelation from Allah, SWT, the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) was displeased with everyday Meccan life: their general behavior towards the poor and the week, their individual and collective characters, cruelty, customs, and idle worship. He used to ponder about it a lot and used to see dreams. He, then took solitary confinement to seek the reality and the truth of this life in a cave at mount Hira, in a nearby hill to Mecca. He used to ponder there days and night. While on the retreat in the cave of Hira one night, archangel Jibril appears before him and commands him to “Read!” the Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) responded that “I cannot read!” Then angel Gabriel embraced and squeezed him tightly and upon release asked him to “Read” and the Prophet (pbuh) again said, “I cannot read.” The angel Jibril squeezed and released two additional times each time squeezing stronger than previous one and commanding him to “Read.” After the third time releasing the Prophet (pbuh,) he revealed to him the first five verses of Quran, Surah al-‘Alaq, 96:1-5: “Read: In the name of thy Lord Who created (1),  Created man from a clot of congealed blood (2), Read: And thy Lord is the Most Bounteous (3),  Who taught (the use of) the pen (4), Taught man that which he knew not (5).” (Bukhari 4953). 

Then the Holy Prophet Mohammad (pbuh) returned home trembling with fear, and said to Syyedah Khadijah: `Cover me, cover me', and he was covered. When he was out of fear, he said: `O Khadijah, what has happened to me?' Then he narrated to her whatever had happened and said: `I fear for my life'. She said, `No never! Be of good cheer. By God, never will God debase you: you treat the kindred well, you speak the truth, you are trustworthy, you bear the burden of the helpless, you help the poor, you entertain the guests, and you cooperate in good works.'

Syyedah Khadijah took the Prophet (pbuh) to Waraqah bin Naufal, her old and blind cousin, who had become a Christian in pre-Islamic days and a knowledgeable person. After hearing the story from the Prophet (pbuh), Waraqah said; `This is the same angel Jibril who brought the words of Allah to Moses. Waraqah literally declared the Prophethood of Muhammad (pbuh).

The Nuzul ul Quran night is not only important for the Muslims but for the Humanity. The Quran and the Prophet (pbuh) were the last book and last Prophet and meant for all Humans!
