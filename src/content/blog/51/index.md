 The Quran is a guidance for humanity. It is the eternal and literal word of Allah. It is a divine book of wisdom, commands, and laws with instructions for nearly every aspect of life. It was revealed about 1500 years ago, on the heart of prophet Muhammad (SAW) over a period of 23 years through angel Jibril. It is divided into 30 sections (juz), 114 chapters (surahs) and over 6000 verses (ayahs). 

There are numerous benefits to reading Quran. Just a few are listed below:

1. To understand the purpose of life. Why are we here? Why did Allah create us? _"We have not created jinns and mankind except to worship Me."_(Quran, 51:56)

2. To receive guidance on how to please Allah with our lives. The only way to know what Allah wants of us is to read His word. _"This is The Book in which there is no doubt. It is a guide for those who are God conscious."_(Quran, 2:2)

3. To attain Jannah and avoid Allah's wrath. Allah teaches us how to live and conduct ourselves in the Quran. _"Shall We then treat the People of Faith like the People of Sin?"_(Quran, 68:35)

4. To increase in Iman. _"The true believers are those whose hearts tremble with fear, when the name of Allah is mentioned, and And when His verses are recited to them, it increases their faith and they put their trust in their Rabb."_(Quran, 8:2)

5. To receive intercession on the day of judgement. Muhammad (SAW) said, "Recite the Quran for it will come as an intercessor for its people on the day of judgement." (Muslim)

6. To cleanse the heart. _"Oh mankind! There has come to you an instruction from your Rabb, a cure for whatever (disease) is in your hearts, a guidance and a blessing for the true believers."_ (Quran, 10:57)

7. To learn what happens after death. _"The righteous will surely be in bliss while the wicked will indeed go to hell."_(Quran, 82:13-14)

8. To be rewarded. "Whoever reads a letter from the Book of Allah will have a reward. And that reward will be multiplied by ten." (Tirmizi) Muhammad (SAW) also said, "One who recites the Quran beautifully, smoothly and precisely will be in the company of noble angels. As for the one who recites it with difficulty, stammering or stumbling through its verses, he will have twice that reward."

9. To be the best of the best. Muhammad (SAW) said, "The best among you are those who learn the Quran and teach it to others." (Sahih al-Bukhari)
