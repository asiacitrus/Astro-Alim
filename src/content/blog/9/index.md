 Alhamdulilah, we're very pleased to announce that we've added Tafsir Ibn Kathir in english to Alim.org. You can enter any ayah on the homepage and click on the "Tafsir" button to see the tafsir for that ayah. The arabic and english translation of the ayaat are displayed above each section of the tafsir and the navigation works fairly smoothly. We're excited because we feel this is the best presentation on the web for this particular tafsir thus far. Please let us know if you find any bugs and spread the word!
