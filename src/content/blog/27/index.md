 Salah is the best time to concentrate to Allah and dedicate all your thoughts to him. Allah will make us really achieved all the good needs we wish. So keep calm while going for Salah and never rush in to Salah to make it just a ritual. Salah is a good practice to reach God and keep calm while going to do the Salah.
