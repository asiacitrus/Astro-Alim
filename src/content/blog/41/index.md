 Dr. Bilal Philips, one of the well known Islamic speakers got a wonderful question from the audience once he was chairing a session. “ Can we drink with our left hand?”. For this funny but serious question has an exact answer that every Muslim must understand. He replied that drinking with your left hand is ofcourse a haram for Islam. Do not drink with your left hand. The reason is Satan drinks with his left hand. He says that drinking with your left hand is a major widespread haram in Islam.
