 Sometimes our children are orphans even if they are living with their parents. Fathers are busy with their business. Mothers are busy with makeup necessary things. Now a days this problem is a growing thing. We are failing to have a good discussion with our children. But here we have to realize the ugly fact that this is the turn our children are getting in to some other ugly relationship. To stop this, you must cut your work time; it might be your own business to make excess wealth. But dear brothers and sisters, what is the meaning of wealth without making our children happy? When you work, ask yourself that, how much you want to earn? Make a target of your earning and work for that and spend the rest of your time to talk and listen to your kids. Life is not all about making money, but it&#8217;s all about happiness and peace.
