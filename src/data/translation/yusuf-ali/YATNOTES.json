    "Body": "The Arabic words \"Rahman\" and \"Rahim\" translated \"Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGracious\" and \"Most Merciful\" are both intensive forms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferring to different aspects of God's attribute of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMercy.\\tThe Arabic intensive is more suited to express\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod's attributes than the superlative degree in English. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe latter implies a comparison with other beings, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith other times or places, while there is no being like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunto God, and He is independent of Time and Place.  Mercy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay imply pity, long-suffering, patience, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforgiveness, all of which the sinner needs and God Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMerciful bestows in abundant measure.  But there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMercy that goes before even the need arises, the Grace\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is ever watchful, and flows from God Most Gracious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto all His creatures, protecting the, preserving them,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguiding them, and leading them to clearer light and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher life.  For this reason the attribute Rahman (Most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGracious) is not applied to any but God, but the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattribute Rahim (Merciful), is a general term, and may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso be applied to Men.  To make us contemplate these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboundless gifts of God, the formula:  \"In the name of God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMost Gracious, Most Merciful\": is placed before every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSura of the Qur-an (except the ninth), and repeated at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning of every act by the Muslim who dedicates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this life to God, and whose hope is in His Mercy."

The emphatic form means that not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly do we reach the position of worshipping God and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasking for His help, but we worship Him alone and ask for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis aid only.  For there is none other than He worthy of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour devotion and able to help us.

The straight Way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis often the narrow Way, or the steep Way, which many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople shun (xc.11).  By the world's perversity the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstraight Way is sometimes stigmatized and the crooked Way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraised.  How are we to judge?\\tWe must ask for God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguidance.

Off they go, striking\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfire with their hoofs by night at the behest of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\triders; they push home the charge in the moming,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchivalrously giving the enemy the benefit of daylight;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand regardless of flashing steel or the weapons of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemies they boldly penetrate into the midst of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfoe, risking their lives for the Cause. Does unregenerate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman show that fidelity to his Lord Allah? On the contrary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the is ungrateful to Allah; he shows that by his deeds; he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis violently in love with wealth and gain and things that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperish.

(see E.B.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKurdistan).

Abraham had by this time passed through the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfire of persecutions in the Mesopotamian valleys: he had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleft behind him the ancestral idolatry of Ur of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChaldees; he had been tried and he had triumphed over the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecution of Nimrud: he had now taken up his residence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Canaan, from which his newphew Lot (Lut) was called to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreach to the wicked Cities of the Plain east of the Dead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsea which is itself called Bahr Lut. Thus prepared and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsanctified, he was now ready to receive the Message that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the was chosen to be the progenitor of a great line of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets, and that Message is now referred to. Can we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlocalise Nimrud? If local tradition in place-names can be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelied upon, this king must have ruled over the tract\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich includes the modern Nimrud, on the Tigris, about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwenty miles south of Mosul. This is the site of Assyrian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truins of great interest, but the rise of Assyria as an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpire was of course much later than the time of Abraham.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe Assyrian city was called Kalakh (or Calah), and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarchaeological excavations carried out there have yielded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvaluable results, which are however irrelevant for our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommentary. A) Abraham received the strangers with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsalutation of Peace, and immediately placed before them a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsumptuous meal of roasted calf. The strangers were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembarrassed. They were angels and did not eat. If\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thospitality is refused, it means that those who refuse it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeditate no good to the would be host. Abraham therefore\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad a feeling of mistrust and fear in his mind, which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrangers at once set at rest by saying that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmission was in the first place to help Lut as a warner to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Cities of Plain.

He pleaded that he was an old man, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould miss Joseph and be sad without him. And after all,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJoseph was not of an age to play with them. They would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattending to their own affairs, and a wolf might come and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattack and kill Joseph. In saying this he was really\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunwittingly giving a cue to the wicked ones, for they use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat very excuse in verse 17 below. Thus the wicked plot\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthickens, but there is a counter-plan also, which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdrawing a noose of lies round the wicked ones, so that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are eventually driven into a corner, and have to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfess their own guilt in verse 91 below, and through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepentance obtain forgiveness."

Perhaps the grieved father contrasted Joseph\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst them, and sometimes spoke of it: \"Why don't you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe good like Joseph?\" This was gall and wormwood to them.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tReal goodness was to them nothing but a name.

The first broad belt that we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistinguish is the Zodiac, which marks the sun's path\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough the heavens year after year and the limit of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twanderings of the moon and the planets. We make twelve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivisions of it and call them Signs of the Zodiac. Each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarks the solar path through the heavens as we see it,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonth after month. We can thus mark off the seasons in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour solar year, and express in definite laws the most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant facts in meteorology, agriculture, seasonal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twinds, and tides. Then there are the mansions of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoon, the mapping out of the Constellations, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother marvellous facts of the heavens, some of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffect our physical life on this earth.

In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treign of a Roman Emperor who persecuted the Christians,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven Christian youths of Ephesus left the town and hid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves in a cave in a mountain near by. They fell\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tasleep, and remained asleep for some generations or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies. When the wall which sealed up the cave was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing demolished, the youths awoke. They still thought of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe world in which they had previously lived. They had no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidea of the duration of time. But when one of them went\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the town to purchase provisions, he found that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole world had changed. The Christian religion, instead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof being persecuted was fashionable: in fact it was now\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe State religion. His dress and speech, and the money\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich he brought, seemed to belong to another world. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattracted attention. The great ones of the land visited\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Cave, and verified the tale by questioning the man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions. When the story became very popular and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcirculated throughout the Roman Empire, we may well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuppose that an Inscription was put up at the mouth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Cave. See verse 9 and n. 2336. This inscription was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably to be seen for many years afterwards, as Ephesus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas a famous city on the west coast of Asia Minor, about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforty to fifty miles south of Smyrna. Later on, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhalifa Wathiq (842-846 A.D.) sent an expedition to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texamine and identify the locality, as he did about the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZul-Qarnain barrier in Central Asia. A popular story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcirculating from mouth to mouth would necessarily be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvague as to dates and vary very much in details.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSomewhere about the 6th century A.D. a Syriac writer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treduced it to writing. He suggested that the youths were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseven in number; that they went to sleep in the reign of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Emperor Decius (who reigned from 249 to 251 A.D., and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho was a violent persecutor of Christianity); and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey awoke in the reign of Theodosius 11, who reigned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom 408 to 450 A.D. In our literature Decius is known as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDaqyanus (from the adjectival Latin from Decianus), and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe name stands as a symbol of injustice and oppression,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand also of things old fashioned and out-of-date, as res\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDecianae must have been two or three centuries after\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDecius."

When the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttradition was reduced to writing, some Christian writers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(e.g., Simeon Metaphrastes) named 372 years, some less.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn round numbers 300 years in the solar Calendar would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamount to 309 in the lunar Calendar. But the next verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpoints out that all these are mere conjectures: the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber is known to Allah alone. The authority on which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGibbon relies mentions two definite reigns, that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDecius (249-251 A.D.) and that of Theodosius 11 (408-450\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA.D.). Taking 250 and 450, we get an interval of 200\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears. But the point of the story does not lie in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tname of any given Emperor, but in the fact that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeginning of the period coincided with an Emperor who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersecuted: the Emperor's name at the end of the period\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay be taken as approximately correct, because the story\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas recorded within two generations afterwards.

The time is when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses (with his family) was travelling and grazing the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflocks of his father-in-law Jethro, just before he got\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this commission from Allah. The place is somewhere near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMount Sinai (Jabal Musa). Moses sees a Fire in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdistance, but when he goes there, he hears a voice that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttells him it is sacred ground. Allah asked him to put off\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this shoes and to draw near, and when he went near, great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmysteries were revealed to him. He was given his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommission, and his brother Aaron was given to him to go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him and aid him. It is after that, that he and Aaron\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twent and faced Pharaoh in Egypt, as narrated in vii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t103-144, etc. The right side of the mountain may mean\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Moses heard the voice from the right side of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmountain as he faced it; or it may have the figurative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of \"right\" in Arabic, i.e., the side which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tblessed or sacred ground."

Lest anyone should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthink that the heavens and the earth were themselves\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprimeval and eternal, we are now told that they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves are creatures of God's will and design.  Cf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvi. 102, where the word bada'a is used as here for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation of the heavens and the earth, and khalaqa is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tused for the creation of all things.  Bada'a goes back to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe very primal beginning, as far as we can conceive it. \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe materialists might say that primeval matter was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teternal; other things, i.e., the forms and shapes as we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee them now, were called into being at some time or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother, and will perish.  When they perish, they dissolve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto primeval matter again, which stands as the base of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall existence. We go further back.  We say that if we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpostulate such primeval matter, it owes its origin itself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto God\\tWho is the final basis of existence, the Cause of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall Causes.  If this is conceded, we proceed to argue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the process of Creation is not then completed.  \"All\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings in the heavens and on the earth\" are created by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgradual processes.  In \"things\" we include abstract as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as material things.  We see the abstract things and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tideas actually growing before us.  But that also is God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation, to which we can apply the word khalaqa, for in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is involved the idea of measuring, fitting it into a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscheme of other things. Cf. liv. 49; also xxv. 59.  Here\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomes in what we know as the process of evolution.  On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other hand, the \"amr\" (=Command, Direction, Design)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a single thing, unrelated to Time, \"like the twinkling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof an eye\" (liv. 50). Another word to note in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnection is ja'ala \"making\" which seems to imply new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshapes and forms, new dispositions, as the making of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSigns of the Zodiac in the heavens, or the setting out of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sun and moon for light, or the establishment of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuccession of day and night (xxv 61-62).  A further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprocess with regard to the soul is described in the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsawwa, bringing it to perfection (xci. 7) but this we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshall discuss in its place.  Fatara (xlii. 11) implies,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlike bada'a, the creating of a thing out of nothing and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter no preexisting similitude, but perhaps fatara\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplies the creation of primeval matter to which further\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprocesses have to be applied later, as when one prepares\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdough but leaves the leavining to be done after.  Badaa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(without the 'ain), xxx. 27, implies beginning the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprocess of creation; this is made further clear in xxxii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t7 where the beginning of the creation of pristine man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom clay refers to his physical body, leaving the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfurther processes of reproduction and the breathing in of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe soul to be described in subsequent verses.\\tLastly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbaraa is creation implying liberation from pre-existing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter or circumstance, e.g, man's body from clay (lix.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t24) or a calamity from previously existing circumstances\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(lvii. 22).

But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was no universal Qibla among them.  Some Jews\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturned towards Jerusalem, especially during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCaptivity, as we shall see later.  At the time of our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, Jerusalem was in the hands of the Byzantine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpire, which was Christian.  But the Christians oriented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir churches to the East (hence the word \"orientation\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is a point of the compass, and not the direction of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany sacred place.  The fact of the altar being in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEast does not mean that every worshipper has his face to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe east; for, according at least to modern practice, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseats in a church are so placed that different\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworshippers may face in different directions.  The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPreacher of Unity naturally wanted, in this as in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatters, a symbol of complete unity, and his heart was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnaturally delighted when the Qibla towards the Ka'ba was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled.

This last view commends itself to me, as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcutting up of the birds to pieces is nowhere mentioned,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless we understand the word for \"Taming\" in an unusual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand almost impossible sense."

Indeed, the kindness and the spirit which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturns a blind eye to other people's faults or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort-comings is the essence of charity:  these things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare better than charity if charity is spoilt by tricks\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat do harm.  At the same time, while no reward is to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpected, there is abundant reward from God - material,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoral, and spiritual - according to His own good pleasure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand plan.  If we spend in the way of God, it is not as if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod was in need of our charity.

One day, he went to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsraelite colony and saw all the Egyptian oppression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder which Israel laboured.

So he fled out of Egypt, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas only saved by Allah's grace. He fled to the Sinai\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPeninsula, to the land of the Midianites, and had various\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadventures.

Whether the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\troot of Samiri was originally Egyptian or Hebrew does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taffect the later history. Four facts may be noted. (1)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere was a man bearing a name of that kind at the time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Moses, and he led a revolt against Moses and was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcursed by Moses. (2) In the time of King Omri (903-896\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tB.C.) of the northern kingdom of Israel, there was a man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled Shemer, from whom, according to the Bible, was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbought a hill on which was built the new capital of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkingdom, the town of Samaria. (3) The name of the hill\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas Shomer (= watchman, vigilant guardian), and that form\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the name also appears as the name of a man (see II\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKings xii. 21); some authorities think the town was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled after the hill and not after the man (Hastings's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEncyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics), but this is for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tour present purposes immaterial. (4) There was and is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdissenting community of Israelites called Samaritans, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave their own separate Pentateuch and Targum, who claim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be the true Children of Israel, and who hold the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOrthodox Jews in contempt as the latter hold them in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontempt; they claim to be the true guardians (Shomerim)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Law, and that is probably the true origin of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tname Samaritan, which may go further back in time than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe foundation of the town of Samaria.

In a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburning passage he denounces false leaders in words which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare eternally true: \"Woe be to the shepherds of Israel\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat do feed themselves!

On the one hand, it protects the light from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmoths and other forms of low life and from gusts of wind,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand on the other, it transmits the fight through a medium\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich is made up of and akin to the grosser substances of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earth (such as sand, soda, potash, etc.), so arranged\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to admit the subtle to the gross by its transparency.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSo the spiritual Truth has to be filtered through human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage or human intelligence to make it intelligible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmankind."

Their mettle and the wisdom and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstrength of their Leader were shown in the battle of Badr\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(iii. 13 and note), in which the Makkan Pagans suffered a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrushing defeat. The Makkans were determined to wipe off\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir disgrace and to annihilate the Muslims in Madinah.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo this end they collected a large force and marched to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah.

To meet the threatened danger\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Messenger of Allah, Muhammad Al-Mustafa, with his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusual foresight, courage, and initiative, resolved to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake his station at the foot of Mount Uhud, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdominates the city of Madinah some three miles to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnorth. Early in the morning, on the 7th of Shawwal, A.H.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t3 (January, 625), he made his dispositions for battle.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMadinah winters are notoriously rigorous, but the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarriors of Islam (700 to 1000 in number) were up early.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tA torrent bed was to their south, and the passes in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thills at their back were filled with 50 archers to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprevent the enemy attack from the rear. The enemy were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tset the task of attacking the walls of Madinah, with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims at their rear. In the beginning the battle went\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell for the Muslims. The enemy wavered, but the Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarchers, in disobedience of their orders, left their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tposts to join in the pursuit and share in the booty.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThere was also treachery on the part of the 300\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Hypocrites\" led by Abdullah ibn Ubai, who deserted. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenemy took advantage of the opening left by the archers,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand there was severe hand-to-hand fighting, in which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumbers told in favour of the enemy. Many of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions and Helpers were killed. But there was no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trout. Among the Muslim martyrs was the gallant Hamza, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrother of the Prophet's father. The graves of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmartyrs are still shown at Uhud. The Messenger himself\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas wounded in his head and face, and one of his front\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteeth was broken. Had it not been for his firmness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourage, and coolness, all would have been lost. As it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas, the prophet, in spite of his wound, and many of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twounded Muslims, inspired by his example, returned to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfield next day, and Abu Sufyan and his Makkan army\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought it most prudent to withdraw.

The more lenient treatment for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfar-off cities is described in the next note. According\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Jewish standard, then, the Banu Quraiza deserved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotal extermination-of men, women, and children. They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere in the territory of Madinah itself, and further they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad broken their engagements and helped the enemy."

Their position was not like that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tordinary women or ordinary wives. They had special duties\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand responsibilities. The only youthful marriage of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tholy Prophet was his first marriage-that with Hadhrat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhadija, the best of women and the best of wives. He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarried her fifteen years before he received his call to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphethood; their married life lasted for twenty-five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears, and their mutual devotion was of the noblest,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudged by spiritual as well as social standards. During\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther life he had no other wife, which was unusual for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman of his standing among his people. When she died, his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tage was 50, and but for two considerations, he would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprobably never have married again, as he was most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabstemious in his physical life. The two considerations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich governed his later marriages were: (1) compassion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand clemency, as when he wanted to provide for suffering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidows, who could not be provided for in any other way in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat stage of society; some of them, like Sauda, had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tissue by their former marriage, requiring protection; (2)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelp in his duties of leadership, with women, who had to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe instructed and kept together in the large Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily, where women and men had similar social rights.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHadhrat Aisha, daughter of Hadhrat Abu Bakr, was clever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand learned, and in Hadith she is an important authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the life of the Prophet. Hadhrat Zainab, daughter of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKhuzaima, was specially devoted to the poor; she was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcalled the \"Mother of the Poor\". The other Zainab,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaughter of Jahsh, also worked for the poor, for whom she\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided from the proceeds of her manual work, as she was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tskillful in leather work. But all the Consorts in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigh position had to work and assist as Mothers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUmmat. Theirs were not idle lives, like those of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOdalisques, either for their own pleasure or the pleasure\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof their husband.

This is said lest people may deify the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet as they did with other Prophets before him. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal responsibility of each individual remains, but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet can lead him on the Right and help him.

Now Isaac was born when Abraham was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t100 years old (Gen. xxi. 5), while Isma'il was born to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham when Abraham was 86 years old (Gen. xvi. 16).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsma'il was therefore 14 years older than Isaac.

As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Commentators tell us, there are in the solar year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly two equinoctial days, when the sun rises due east:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton every other the sun rises at a shifting point either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnorth or south of due east. In vii. 137 we have Mashariq\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal ardhi wa magaribaha, where the plural of the words for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEast and West is negligible, as the conjunction of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwo embraces all points. The same may be said of lxx. 40,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhere Allah is called \"Lord of all points in the East and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe West\". If we are speaking of longitudes, they may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembrace all latitudes. In lv. 17 Allah is called \"Lord of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe two Easts and the two Wests\", referring to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textreme points in either case. A cursory reader may ask,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhy is only the East referred to here? The reply is that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is not so much the East as the rising of the sun, on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich stress is laid. The Arabic mashriq or mashariq is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclose enough to the root-word sharaqa, to suggest, not so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch the East as the rising of the sun, especially when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe plural form is used. The glorious sun rises from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferent points, as seen by us, but it illuminates the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole heaven and earth. It is an emblem of Unity."

The mental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprocesses (and certainly volition) are also suspended in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsleep, except that in ordinary dreams there is a medley\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof recollections, which often present vividly to our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciousness things that do not or cannot happen in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature as we know it in our coordinated minds. But there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis another kind of dream which is rarer-one in which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdreamer sees things as they actually happen, backwards or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforwards in time, or in which gifted individuals see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritual truths otherwise imperceptible to them. How can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe explain this? It is suggested that our soul or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonality,-that something which is above our animal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife-is then in a plane of spiritual existence akin to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphysical death (see last note), when we are nearer to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah.

The Marcionite Gospel (about A.D. 138) denied that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJesus was born, and merely said that he appeared in human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform.

This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate is called Chaos as opposed to Cosmos in Greek\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCosmogony.

In the Biblical cosmogony,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Gen. i, and ii. 1-7), which reflects old Babylonian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcosmogony, the scheme is apparently to be taken literally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas to days and is as follows. The first day Allah created\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlight; the second, the firmament; the third, the earth\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand vegetation; the fourth, the stars and plants; the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfifth, fish and fowl from the sea; and the sixth, cattle,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreeping things, beasts on land, and man; on the seventh\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tday He ended His work and rested.

(1) Allah did not rest, and never rests. \"His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThrone doth extend over the heavens and the earth, and He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfeeleth no fatigue in guarding and preserving them\"; (2)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's work has not ended; His activity still goes on:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\txxxii. 5; vii, 54; (3) man in our scheme does not come in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith land animals; his advent is much later; (4) our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstages are not sharply divided from each other, as in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove scheme, where the stars and planets having been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreated on the fourth day, it is not intelligible how the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst three days were counted, nor how vegetation grew on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe third day. Our stages for earth and heaven are not in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsequence of time for the heavens and the earth.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost you can do is to demand equal redress, i.e., a harm\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalent to the harm done to you. Even this may serve\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto curb your unregenerate soul, or a community bent on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevenge.

At both the places\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit repudiates the false claims of the People of the Book\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they had a special relationship with Allah for they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere the children of Abraham; that they were a chosen\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople with special privileges, and no matter what they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid, their high status would remain unaffected. Here this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfalse notion is refuted and the People of the Book are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing reminded that it is through sincere belief and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trighteous conduct rather than pretentious claims that man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan win his Lord's pleasure and achieve ultimate success.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe verse does not purport to lay down an exhaustive list\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the articles of faith. Nor does it seek to spell out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe essentials of a genuine belief in Allah, which has no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning unless it is accompanied by belief in His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphets for it is through their agency alone that we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow Allah's Will and can abide by it in our practical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlives. This is especially true of His final Prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad (peace be on him) whose message is universal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand not confined to any particular group or section of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thumanity. Belief in the Prophethood of Muhammad (peace be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton him) is thus an integral part and a logical corollary\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof belief in Allah.

Let us examine these in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdetail. Each of them has a figurative meaning. (1) The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMount is the sublime world of Revelation. In the case of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses it is typified by Mount Sinai: Cf. xcv. 2, where it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis mentioned in juxtaposition to the sacred territory of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMakkah, xcv. 3.

He must form the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesign in his mind; he must prepare himself by research,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcollection of knowledge, or of personal experience; he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust use or acquire the art of writing; he must collect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe materials for writing, viz., paper, ink, pen, etc.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand this will connect with a chain of manufacturing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprocesses in which he is dependent upon other people's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twork and experience; then his book may have to be printed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor lightographed or bound, and sold, or taken to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlibrary, or presented to a friend, which will bring into\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplay numerous other chains of processes, and dependence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon other people's work or skill; and the lag of Time,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSpace, and Circumstance will occur at numerous stages. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Command, the word \"Be\" (kun) includes everything,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout the intervention, of or dependence upon any other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing or thing whatever.

God in His infinite compassion bears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith them, and asks those who have purer ideas of faith\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot to vilify the weaknesses of their neighbours, lest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe neighbours in their turn vilify the real truth and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake matters even worse than before. In so far as there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis active evil, He will deal with it in His own way. Of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourse the righteous man must not hide his light under a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbushel, or compromise with evil, or refuse to establish\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright living where he has the power to do so."

The commentators usually cite the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowing incident in connection with the revelation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese verses. It is narrated from 'Aisha, the wife of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tholy Prophet (peace be on him) by Bukhari, Muslim, Nasai.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbu Dawud and others that the holy Prophet usually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvisited all his wives daily after 'Asr Prayer.

So when his wives hinted at it, he vowed that he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould never again use honey. Thereupon these verses were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed reminding him that he should not declare to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thimself unlawful that which Allah had made lawful to him.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe important point to bear in mind is that he was at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonce rectified by revelation, which reinforces the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the prophets are always under divine protection, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teven the slightest lapse on their part is never left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncorrected."

All these foibles are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshown, but the Mercy of Allah is boundless, and even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafter the worst sins and punishments, there may be hope\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof an even better orchard than the one lost, if only the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trepentance is true, and there is complete surrender to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah's Will. But if, in spite of ail this, there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrender of the will, then, indeed, the punishment in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hereafter is something incomparably greater than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle calamities in the Parable."

Israel prospered in Egypt, and stayed there\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperhaps two to four centuries. (Renan allows only one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcentury). Times changed, and the racial bigotry of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEgyptians showed its head again, and Israel was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toppressed. Moses was raised up with a threefold mission\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagain (a) to learn all the learning of the Egyptians and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreach Allah's Truth to them as one who had been brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tup among themselves, (b) to unite and reclaim his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople, and (c) to rescue them and lead them to a new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworld, which was to open out their spiritual horizon and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlead them to the Psalms of David and the glories of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSolomon."

The highest Teacher had to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfree from any such taint, just as a clean slate is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnecessary if a perfectly clear and bold message has to be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twritten on it. (3) In iii.20 and lxii. 2, the epithet is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapplied to the Pagan Arabs, because, before the advent of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam, they were unlearned."

Under\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses the Israelites waged a war of extermination against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem: they slew the kings of Midian, slaughtered all the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmales, burnt their cities and castles, and captured their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcattle (Num. xxxi, 7-1 1). This sounds like total\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textermination. Yet a few generations afterwards, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere so powerful that the Israelites for their sins were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdelivered into the captivity of the Midianites for seven\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyears: both the Midianites and their camels were without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber: and the Israelites hid from them in \"dens.....\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaves, and strongholds\" (Judges vii. 1- 6). Gideon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestroyed them again, (Judges vii. 1-25), say about two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies after Moses. As the decisive battle was near\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe hill of Moreh, not far south of Mount Tabor, we may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlocalise the Midianites on this occasion in the northern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of the Jordan valley, at least 200 miles north of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Sinai Peninsula. This and the previous destruction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder Moses were local, and mention no town of Midian. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater times there was a town of Madyan on the cast side\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Gulf of 'Aqaba. It is mentioned in Josephus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEusebius, and Ptolemy: (Encyclopaedia of Islam). Then it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisappears from geography. In Muslim times it was a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevived town with quite a different kind of population,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut it never flourished. The Midianites disappeared from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory."

His identification with Jethro,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe father-in-law of Moses, has no warrant, and I reject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. There is no similarity either in names or incidents,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand there are chronological difficulties (see n. 1064\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelow). If, as the Commentators tell us, Shuaib was in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fourth generation from Abraham, being a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgreat-grandson of Madyan (a son of Abraham), he would be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly about a century from the time of Abraham, whereas\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Hebrew Bible would give us a period of four to six\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies between Abraham and Moses. The mere fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJathro was a Midianite and that another name, Hobab, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned for a father-in-law of Moses in Num x. 29, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslender ground for identificaion. As the Midianites were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmainly a nomad tribe, we need not be surprised that their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdestruction in one or two settlements did not affect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir life in wandering sections of the tribe in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeographical regions. Shu'aib's mission was apparently in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone of the settled towns of the Midianites, which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletely destroyed by an earthquake (vii. 91). If this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappened in the century after Abraham, there is no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulty in supposing that they were again a numerous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe, three or five centuries later, in the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses (see last note). As they were a mixed wandering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe, both their resilience and their eventual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabsorption can be easily understood. But the destruction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the settlement or settlements (if the Wood or Aika was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta separate settlement, see n. 2000 to xv. 78) to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tShu'aib was sent to preach was complete, and no traces of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit now remain. The name of the highest mountain of Yemen,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNabi Shu'aib (11,000 ft.) has probably no connection with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe geographical territory of the nomad Midianites,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunless we suppose that their wanderings extended so far\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsouth from the territories mentioned in the last note."

(2) What was the result in the case of those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfell into sin? Will you not take warning by their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texample?

(4) Having acquired\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe material advantages, the next step will be to keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tothers out of them, to prevent hoarded wealth from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfructifying by circulation, to conceal it from envy or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspite.

The Essenes, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJewish brotherhood with highly spiritual ideas; to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperhaps the prophet Jesus himself belonged, had an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textensive literature of angelology.

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEastern Christian sects contemporary with the birth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam had borrowed and developed many of these ideas, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir mystics owed much to the Gnostics and the Persian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapocalyptic systems.

In the Old Testament (Daniel vii.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t9-10) the essence of all angels is fire: thousand\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthousands of them issued as a fiery stream from before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Ancient of Days, whose \"throne was like the fiery\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflame, and His wheels as burning fire\"."

As to (1), \"morning and evening\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeans all the waking hours of our life, but in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecial hours of morning and evening the physical world\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout us, and the inner world within us, combine to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake us specially receptive of spiritual influences.

The preeminently Great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSign was therefore the fact of Moses being sent to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPharaoh, which subsequently converted the magicians and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe more learned Egyptians to the true God (xx. 70-73),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthough Pharaoh and his Chiefs resisted and suffered for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir sins."

One, which had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleast danger for the time being, and also promised much\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbooty, was to fall upon the Quraish caravan returning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom Syria to Makkah richly laden, and led by Aba Sufyan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith only 40 men unarmed. From a wordly point of view\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis was the safest and most lucrative course.

In one aspect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is a statement of the Golden Rule. 'Do as you would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe done by'. But it is more completely expressed. You\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust give in full what it due from you, whether you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpect or wish to receive full consideration from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother side or not."

For brevity I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly used \"maintain\" in the Translation. Before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreaching of Islam the Pagans built, repaired, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintained the Mosque, and celebrated Pagan ceremonies in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit. They made an income out of it.

When the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere strong enough to re-take Makkah (A.H. 8), they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurified the Mosque and re-established the worship of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrue God.

They\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondemn the arbitrary and selfish conduct of the Pagan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs, who, because there was a long-established custom\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof observing four months as those in which fighting was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforbidden, changed the months about or added or deducted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmonths when it suited them, to get an unfair advantage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover the enemy. The four Prohibited Months were:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZul-qa'dah, Zul- hijjah, Muharram, and Rajab. If it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuited them they postponed one of these months, and so a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibited month became an ordinary month: while their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topponents might hesitate to fight, they got an undue\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvantage. It also upset the security of the Month of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tPilgrimage. This very ancient usage made for fair dealing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall round, and its infraction by the Pagans is condemned.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe question of a solar astronomical year as against the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlunar Islamic year does not arise here. But it may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnoted that the Arab year was roughly luni solar like the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHindu year, the months being lunar and the intercalation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a month every three years brought the year nearly but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot accurately up to the solar reckoning. From the year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Farewell Pilgrimage (A.H.10) the Islamic year was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitely fixed as a purely lunar year of roughly 354\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdays, the months being calculated by the actual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance of the moon. After that, every month of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic year came about 11 days earlier in the solar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear, and thus the Islamic months travelled all round the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseasons and the solar year."
