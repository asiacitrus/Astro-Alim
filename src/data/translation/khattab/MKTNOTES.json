    "Text": "  &nbsp;Generally speaking, there is a difference between witnessing and giving testimony before a judge. Verse 2:282 talks about witnessing a debt contract, not giving testimony. To fully understand the context of this verse, we need to keep in mind that 1500 years ago women did not normally participate in business transactions or travel with trading caravans and, therefore, not every woman had the expertise to witness a debt contract. Even if two women were available at the time of signing the contract, perhaps the primary witness might not be able to recall the details of the contract or appear before a judge because of compelling circumstances such as pregnancy or delivery. In any of these cases, the second woman will be a back-up. Some scholars maintain that one woman can be sufficient as a witness so long as she is reliable. As for giving testimony, a ruling can be made based on available testimony, regardless of the number or gender of the witnesses. For example, the beginning of Rama&#7693;&acirc;n is usually confirmed by the sighting of the new moon, regardless of the gender of the person who sights the moon. Also the highest form of witness in Islam is for someone to testify they heard a narration (or &#7717;ad&icirc;th) from the Prophet (&#65018;). An authentic &#7717;ad&icirc;th&nbsp;is accepted by all Muslims regardless of the gender of the narrator. Moreover, if a husband accuses his wife of adultery and he has no witnesses, each spouse must testify five times that they are telling the truth and the other side is lying. Both testimonies are equal (see&nbsp;24:6-10). In some cases, only women&rsquo;s testimony is accepted while men&rsquo;s testimony is rejected, such as testifying regarding a woman&rsquo;s pregnancy or virginity.   "

According to Islamic teachings, no free person can be enslaved. Islam also improved the condition of slaves. It was unlawful to separate a mother from her child. Children born to a slave-master were deemed free, and their mother would gain her freedom upon the death of her master. With regards to slaves, Prophet Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) says, &ldquo;Feed them from what you eat, clothe them from what you wear, and do not overwhelm them with work unless you assist them.&rdquo; He (&#65018;) also says, &ldquo;Whoever kills his slave will be killed and whoever injures his slave will be injured.&rdquo; In recent times, slavery has been outlawed in all countries&mdash;including the Muslim world.

Both tribes decided to attack the Muslims, so the Prophet (&#65018;) led an army of 12 000 soldiers to attack the two tribes. Since that was the largest Muslim army ever mobilized, some Muslims expressed their conviction that such an army could not be defeated. However, on the way to battle, the Muslim army was ambushed and most soldiers fled, except for the Prophet (&#65018;) and a few loyalists. Eventually, the Muslims were re-organized and won a decisive battle.   "

It was a time of hardship because of the scorching heat, the long distance, and the financial situation of the Muslims. Although the Prophet (&#65018;) was able to mobilize over 30 000 Muslims for battle, many others did not join the army with or without valid excuses. Eventually, the Roman forces were discouraged from fighting and fled to Damascus and other cities under Roman rule. Therefore, the Prophet (&#65018;) returned to Medina with a feeling of triumph.

This journey came as a comfort for the Prophet after several years of hardship and persecution, which included a 3-year siege by Meccan pagans, who drove the Muslims out of the city and forbade anyone from trading, marrying, or feeding them. This was followed by the &ldquo;Year of Sadness,&rdquo; which included the death of the Prophet&rsquo;s uncle Abu &#7788;&acirc;lib, the major defender of Mu&#7717;ammad (&#65018;) despite his disbelief in his message, as well as the death of the Prophet&rsquo;s beloved wife Khad&icirc;jah. The Prophet was carried overnight by a noble steed (called Bur&acirc;q) from Mecca to Jerusalem where he met some earlier prophets and led them in prayer. He was later carried to the heavens (this journey is called Al-Mi&rsquo;r&acirc;j, or the Ascension) where he received direct orders from Allah to observe five daily prayers. The Ascension is referred to in 53:13&ndash;18.  "

Based on 4:48, the only unforgivable sin in Islam is if someone dies while disbelieving in Allah or associating others with Him in worship. In an authentic narration collected by At-Tirmi&#11372;i, the Prophet (&#65018;) reports that Almighty Allah says, \"O children of Adam! As long as you call upon Me, putting your hope in Me, I will forgive you for what you have done, and I will not mind. O &nbsp;children of Adam! If your sins were to reach the clouds of the sky and then you sought My forgiveness, I would &#761;still&#762; forgive you. O &nbsp;children of Adam! If you were to come to Me with sins filling the whole world and then you came to Me without associating other gods with Me, I would certainly match your sins with forgiveness.\"   "

The Prophet (&#65018;) and 1400 of his companions travelled to Mecca to perform the minor pilgrimage (&rsquo;umrah) in 6 A.H./628 C.E. He (&#65018;) sent &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n ibn &rsquo;Aff&acirc;n to let the Meccans know that the Muslims had come in peace, only to visit the Sacred House. When the Meccans delayed &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n, the Prophet (&#65018;) thought they might have killed his envoy. So he (&#65018;) called upon the faithful to pledge allegiance to him under a tree at &#7716;udaibiyah in the outskirts of Mecca. Shortly after, &rsquo;Uthm&acirc;n returned safely and a peace agreement was signed by the Muslims and Meccan pagans, stating in part that the Muslims would have to return to Medina and come back next year for &rsquo;umrah. The Treaty of &#7716;udaibiyah is described as a clear triumph since it established peace, temporarily diffused the tension between the Muslims and the Meccan pagans, and gave the Muslims plenty of time to spread awareness and understanding of their faith. Thousands from different tribes accepted Islam during that truce.  "

This statement had been considered to be a form of divorce (known as &#7827;ih&acirc;r) in Arabia. Khawlah came to the Prophet (&#65018;) to ask for his opinion. He (&#65018;) told her that he had not received any revelation in this regard, and that, based on tradition, she was divorced. She argued that she and her husband had children together who would suffer if their parents were separated. Then she started to plead to Allah as the Prophet (&#65018;) repeated the same answer.

The Prophet (&#65018;) was retreating at a cave in the outskirts of Mecca when the angel Gabriel appeared to him, squeezing him tightly and ordering him to read. Since the Prophet (&#65018;) was unlettered, he responded, &ldquo;I cannot read.&rdquo; Ultimately, Gabriel taught him: &ldquo;Read in the Name of your Lord &hellip;&rdquo; Some scholars believe that this encounter is the fulfilment of Isaiah 29:12, which states, &ldquo;Then the book will be given to the one who is illiterate, saying, &lsquo;Read this.&rsquo; And he will say, &lsquo;I cannot read.&rsquo;&rdquo;  "
