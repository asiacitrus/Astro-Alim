From the very earliest times,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic scholars have endeavoured to define the exact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshades of meaning which differentiate the two terms. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbest and simplest of these explanations is undoubtedly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one advanced by Ibn al-Qayyim (as quoted in Manar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tI,48): the term rahman circumscribes the quality of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabounding grace inherent in, and inseparable from, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of God's Being, whereas rahim expresses the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanifestation of that grace in, and its effect upon, His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation - in other words, an aspect of His activity."

    "Body": "In this instance, the term \"worlds\" denotes all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories of existence both in the physical and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritual sense. The Arabic expression rabb - rendered by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme as \"Sustainer\" - embraces a wide complex of meanings\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot easily expressed by a single term in another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage. It comprises the ideas of having a just claim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the possession of anything and, consequently,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority over it, as well as of rearing, sustaining and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfostering anything from its inception to its final\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompletion. Thus, the head of a family is called rabb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tad-dar (\"master of the house\") because he has authority\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover it and is responsible for its maintenance;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilarly, his wife is called rabbat ad-dar (\"mistress of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe house\"). Preceded by the definite article al, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesignation rabb is applied, in the Qur'an, exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto God as the sole fosterer and sustainer of all creation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- objective as well as conceptual - and therefore the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tultimate source of all authority."

Some commentators (e.g., Zamakhshari)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpret this passage as follows: \"...the way of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon whom Thou hast bestowed Thy blessings - those who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave not been condemned [by Thee], and who do not go\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tastray\": in other words, they regard the last two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressions as defining \"those upon whom Thou hast\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestowed Thy blessings\". Other commentators (e.g.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBaghawi and Ibn Kathir) do not subscribe to this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation - which would imply the use of negative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitions - and understand the last verse of the surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the manner rendered by me above. As regards the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategories of people following a wrong course, some of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe greatest Islamic thinkers (e.g., Al-Ghazali or, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trecent times, Muhammad 'Abduh) held the view that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople described as having incurred \"God's condemnation\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- that is, having deprived themselves of His grace - are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who have become fully cognizant of God's message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, having understood it, have rejected it; while by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"those who go astray\" are meant people whom the truth has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teither not reached at all, or to whom it has come in so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgarbled and corrupted a form as to make it difficult for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to recognize it as the truth (see 'Abduh in Manar I,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t68 ff.)."

As is shown elsewhere in the Qur'an (e.g., in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 20:109 ,  21:28  or  34:23 ), God will grant to His\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophets on Judgment Day the permission to \"intercede\",\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsymbolically, for such of the sinners as will have\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talready achieved His redemptive acceptance (rida') by\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvirtue of their repentance or basic goodness (see  19:87 \r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the corresponding note [74]): in other words, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tright of \"intercession\" thus granted to the prophets will\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe but an expression of God's approval of the latter.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, the above denial of the possibility of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunqualified intercession stresses, indirectly, not only\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod's omniscience - which requires no \"mediator\" - but\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso the immutability of His will: and thus it connects\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the preceding mention of His almightiness.

However, neither the interrogative nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above-mentioned literal rendering would bring out the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurport of this passage.

There is no idiomatic equivalent in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmodern English to convey this meaning. The nearest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproach to it would be, I believe, the archaic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texclamation \"alack\", expressive of deep sorrow or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treproach; but the use of this expression (probably a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompound of \"ah! lack!\" - i.e., loss or misfortune) is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\truled out by its obsoleteness.

As explained in note [114]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton  11:82 , this latter term is synonymous with sijill,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich signifies \"a writing\" and, tropically, \"something\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat has been decreed [by God]\": hence, the phrase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thijarah min sijjil is a metaphor for \"stone-hard blows of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchastisement pre-ordained\", i.e., in God's decree\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Zamakhshari and Razi, with analogous comments on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame expression in  11:82 ). As already mentioned in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintroductory note, the particular chastisement to which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above verse alludes seems to have been a sudden\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tepidemic of extreme virulence: according to Waqidi and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad ibn Ishaq - the latter as quoted by Ibn Hisham\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ibn Kathir - \"this was the first time that spotted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfever (hasbah) and smallpox (judari) appeared in the land\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Arabs\". It is interesting to note that the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thasbah - which, according to some authorities, signifies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso typhus - primarily means \"pelting [or smiting\"] with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstones\" (Qamus). - As regards the noun ta'ir (of which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttayr is the plural), we ought to remember that it denotes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany \"flying creature\", whether bird or insect (Taj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Arus). Neither the Qur'an nor any authentic Tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffers us any evidence as to the nature of the \"flying\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures\" mentioned in the above verse; and since, on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe other hand, all the \"descriptions\" indulged in by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators are purely imaginary, they need not be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseriously considered. If the hypothesis of an epidemic is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorrect, the \"flying creatures\" - whether birds or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsects - may well have been the carriers of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinfection. One thing, however, is clear: whatever the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnature of the doom that overtook the invading force, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas certainly miraculous in the true sense of this word -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely, in the sudden, totally unexpected rescue which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrought to the distressed people of Mecca."

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstress here is on the intrinsic impossibility of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treconciling belief in the One God, whose omniscience and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tomnipotence embraces all that exists, with an attribution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof divine or semi-divine qualities and functions to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanyone or anything else. The subtly-veiled suggestion of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Thamud (see note [92]) and its rejection by Salih has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta bearing on all religious attitudes based on a desire to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"bring God closer to man\" through the interposition of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talleged \"mediators\" between Him and man. In primitive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligions, this interposition led to the deification of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvarious forces of nature and, subsequently, to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvention of imaginary deities which were thought to act\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagainst the background of an undefined, dimly-perceived\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSupreme Power (for instance, the Moira of the ancient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGreeks). In higher religious concepts, this need for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmediation assumes the form of personified manifestations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof God through subordinate deities (as is the case, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHinduism, with the personifications of the Absolute\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBrahma of the Upanishads and the Vedanta in the forms of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tVishnu or Shiva), or in His supposed incarnation in human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform (as represented in the Christian idea of Jesus as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"God's son\" and the Second Person of the Trinity). And,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlastly, God is supposedly \"brought closer to man\" by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterposition of a hierarchy of saints, living or dead,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhose intercession is sought even by people who consider\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves to be \"monotheists\" - and this includes many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisguided Muslims who do not realize that their belief in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaints as \"mediators\" between men and God conflicts with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe very essence of Islam. The ever-recurring Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstress on the oneness and uniqueness of God, and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategorical denial of the idea that anyone or anything -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhether it be a concrete being or an abstract force -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcould have the least share in God's qualities or the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tleast influence on the manner in which He governs the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniverse aims at freeing man from the self-imposed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservitude to an imaginary hierarchy of \"mediating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpowers\", and at making him realize that \"wherever you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tturn there is God's countenance\" (2:115), and that God is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"[always] near, responding [to the call of whoever calls\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunto Him]\" ( 2:186 ; also, in a condensed form, in verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{61} of this surah)."

It should be borne in mind that the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverb qassa (the infinitive nouns of which are qasas and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tiqtisas) signifies, primarily, \"he followed step by step\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor \"by degrees\", and, subsequently, \"he related [a piece\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof news or a story] as though he followed its traces\":\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thence, \"he expounded [it] gradually\" or \"he explained\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[it]\" (cf. Lane VII, 2526, quoting the Qamus and the Taj\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Arus with specific reference to the above verse). If,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the other hand, the infinitive noun qasas is regarded\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas synonymous, in this context, with qissah (\"story\" or\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"narrative\"), the above sentence might be rendered as \"We\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrate unto thee the best of narratives\", i.e., the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubsequent story of Joseph. In my opinion, however, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trendering \"We explain it [i.e., the Qur'an] in the best\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible way\" is preferable inasmuch as it fully\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoincides with the two opening verses of this surah,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich state, in effect, that the Qur'an is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself-explanatory."

This extremely plausible explanation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontrasts sharply with the Biblical account of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincident (Genesis xliv), according to which the false\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccusation was part of an inexplicable \"stratagem\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevised by Joseph. If we discard - as we must - this part\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Biblical version, it is far more logical to assume\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Joseph who had been granted by the King full\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority over all that belonged to the latter (see verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{56} above), had placed the royal cup as a present in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbag of his favourite brother; and that he did this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsecretly, without informing his servants, because he did\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot want anyone, least of all his ten half-brothers, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknow his predilection for Benjamin.

Joseph had wanted to keep Benjamin with himself,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut under the law of Egypt he could not do this without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe consent of his half-brothers, who were the legal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguardians of their minor brother; and they - bound as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey were by the solemn promise given to their father -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould certainly not have agreed to Benjamin's remaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehind. The only other alternative open to Joseph was to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisclose his identity to them; but since he was not yet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprepared to go so far, he was obliged to allow Benjamin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto depart with his brothers. The accidental discovery of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this gift, entirely unexpected by Joseph (see note [72]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove), changed everything: for now Benjamin appeared to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe guilty of theft, and under the law of the land Joseph\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas entitled to claim him as his slave, and thus to keep\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim in his house.

Most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe classical commentators understand by mu'aqqibat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"hosts of angels\", i.e., the recording angels who attend\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton every human being, succeeding one another without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterruption. Consequently, they interpret the phrase min\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbayni yadayhi wa-min khalfihi as meaning \"ranged before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim and behind him\", i.e., surrounding man from all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsides; and they explain the words \"from God's command\" as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing here synonymous with \"by God's command\", and take\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem to refer to the angels or to their function of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguardianship. However, this interpretation has by no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeans the support of all the commentators. Some of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearliest ones assume that the term mu'aqqibat refers to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall manner of worldly forces or concepts on which man so\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toften relies in the mistaken belief that they might help\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim to achieve his aims independently of God's will: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is the meaning given to this elliptic passage by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamous commentator Abu Muslim al-Isfahani, as quoted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazi. Explaining verse {10} and the first part of verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{11}, he says: \"All alike are, in God's knowledge, deeds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone secretly or openly, as well as he who hides in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdarkness of night and he who walks [boldly] in the light\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof day...: for he that resorts to the [cover of] night\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan never elude God's will (amr), just as he [cannot]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat walks in the light of day, surrounded by hosts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thelpers (mu'aqqibat) - that is, guards and aids - meant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto protect him: [for] those guards of his cannot save him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom [the will of] God.\" It is on this convincing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation that I have based my rendering. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tworldly \"guards and aids\" on which a sinner relies may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttangible (like wealth, progeny, etc.) or intangible (like\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersonal power, high social standing, or the belief in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone's \"luck\"): and this explains the phrase \"both such as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcan be perceived by him and such as are hidden from him\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(see preceding note)."

In his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary on the above verse, Zamakhshari stresses this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taspect of free choice on the part of man and points out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat \"God does not cause anyone to go astray except one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho, as He knows, will never attain to faith; and He does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot guide anyone aright except one who, as He knows, will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattain to faith.

Thus, He does not forsake anyone\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texcept those who deserve to be forsaken, and does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestow His favour upon anyone except those who deserve to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe favoured.\" Commenting on the identical phrase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurring in  16:93 , Zamakhshari states: \"[God] forsakes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim who, as He knows, will [consciously] choose to deny\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe truth and will persevere in this [denial]; and...He\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestows His favour upon him who, as He knows, will choose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith: which means that He makes the issue dependent on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[man's] free choice (al-ikhtiyar), and thus on his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserving either [God's] favour or the withdrawal of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[His] aid...and does not make it dependent on compulsion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[i.e., predestination], which would rule out [man's]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeserving anything of the above.\""

Since sadid signifies\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanything that is repulsive, it is also used tropically to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescribe the pus that flows from wounds or the viscous\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliquid that oozes from corpses.

It should also\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe remembered that the concept of \"hell\" as such is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferred to in the Qur'an under seven different names,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of them metaphorical (necessarily so, because they\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelate to what the Qur'an describes as al-ghayb,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"something that is beyond the reach of human\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperception\"): namely nar (\"fire, which is the general\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm), jahannam (\"hell\"), jahim (\"blazing fire\"), sa'ir\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"blazing flame\"), saqar (\"hell-fire\"), laza (\"raging\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tflame\"), and hutamah (\"crushing torment\"). Since, as I\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave mentioned, these designations of other-worldly\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuffering are obviously allegorical, we may also assume\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the \"seven gates of hell\" have the same character,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand signify \"seven approaches [or \"ways\"] to hell\".\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFurthermore, it is well known that in the Semitic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguages - and most particularly in classical Arabic -\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe number \"seven\" is often used in the sense of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"several\" or \"various\" (cf. Lisan al-'Arab, Taj al -Arus,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tetc.): and so the above Qur'anic phrase may well have the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of \"various ways leading to hell\" - in other\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, many ways of sinning."

In the words of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZamakhshari, \"one interpretation is that after having\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen a [mere] drop of sperm, a particle of matter without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciousness or motion, man becomes highly articulate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(mintiq), able to argue on his own [for or against a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproposition], courageously facing disputes, and clearly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tformulating his arguments: [and herein lies] an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindication of God's creative power. The other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[interpretation] is that man is [prone to become] a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontender in argument against his Sustainer, refusing to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledge his [very] Creator.\" Razi, on his part, gives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this unqualified support to the first of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations, \"because the above verses are meant to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstress the evidence of the existence of a wise Creator,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand not the fact of men's insolence and their proneness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto blasphemy and ingratitude\". However, in view of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{36:77-78} (revealed at a considerably earlier period), I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tam of the opinion that the above two interpretations are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot mutually exclusive but, rather, complementary,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinasmuch as this passage is meant to bring out man's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunique quality as a rational being - a quality that may\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlead him to great heights of achievement, but may equally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell lead him utterly astray: hence my free rendering of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis profound, elliptic phrase."

In many places\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an stresses the fact that the Prophet Muhammad,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdespite his being the last and greatest of God's\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapostles, was not empowered to perform miracles similar\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto those with which the earlier prophets are said to have\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treinforced their verbal messages. His only miracle was\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand is the Qur'an itself - a message perfect in its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlucidity and ethical comprehensiveness, destined for all\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttimes and all stages of human development, addressed not\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely to the feelings but also to the minds of men, open\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto everyone, whatever his race or social environment, and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbound to remain unchanged forever. Since the earlier\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophets invariably appealed to their own community and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir own time alone, their teachings were, of necessity,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcircumscribed by the social and intellectual conditions\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof that particular community and time; and since the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople to whom they addressed themselves had not yet\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached the stage of independent thinking, those prophets\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstood in need of symbolic portents or miracles (see surah\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{6}, note [94]) in order to make the people concerned\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize the inner truth of their mission. The message of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an, on the other hand, was revealed at a time\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhen mankind (and, in particular, that part of it which\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinhabited the regions marked by the earlier,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJudaeo-Christian religious development) had reached a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdegree of maturity which henceforth enabled it to grasp\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan idealogy as such without the aid of those persuasive\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tportents and miraculous demonstrations which in the past,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the above verse points out, only too often gave rise\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto new, grave misconceptions."

In this instance, it evidently\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarks a connection with verse {54} above (\"many facets\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave We given in this Qur'an to every kind of lesson\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[designed] for [the benefit of] mankind\"), and introduces\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan allegory meant to illustrate the fact that knowledge,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand particularly spiritual knowledge, is inexhaustible,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso that no human being- not even a prophet- can ever\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclaim to possess answers to all the questions that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperplex man throughout his life. (This idea is brought\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout fully in the last two verses of this surah.) The\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubsequent parable of Moses and his quest for knowledge\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(verses {60-82}) has become, in the course of time, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnucleus of innumerable legends with which we are not\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcerned here. We have, however, a Tradition on the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthority of Ubayy ibn Ka'b (recorded in several versions\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby Bukhari, Muslim and Tirmidhi), according to which\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMoses was rebuked by God for having once asserted that he\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas the wisest of all men, and was subsequently told\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough revelation that a \"servant of God\" who lived at\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe \"junction of the two seas\" was far superior to him in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twisdom. When Moses expressed his eagerness to find that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman, God commanded him to \"take a fish in a basket\" and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto go on and on until the fish would disappear: and its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisappearance was to be a sign that the goal had been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treached. - There is no doubt that this Tradition is a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tkind of allegorical introduction to our Qur'anic parable.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tThe \"fish\" mentioned in the latter as well as in the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove-mentioned hadith is an ancient religious symbol,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibly signifying divine knowledge or life eternal. As\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor the \"junction of the two seas\", which many of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly commentators endeavoured to \"identify\" in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeographical terms (ranging from the meeting of the Red\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSea and the Indian Ocean at the Bab al-Mandab to that of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Mediterranean Sea and the Atlantic Ocean at the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tStraits of Gibraltar), Baydawi offers, in his commentary\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton verse {60}, a purely allegorical explanation: the \"two\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseas\" represent the two sources or streams of knowledge -\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe one obtainable through the observation and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintellectual coordination of outward phenomena ('ilm\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taz-zahir), and the other through intuitive, mystic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinsight ('ilm al-batin) - the meeting of which is the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal goal of Moses' quest."

The\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclassical commentators incline to the first of these\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings (\"the Two-Horned\"); and in this they appear to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been influenced by the ancient Middle-Eastern\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timagery of \"horns\" as symbols of power and greatness,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough the Qur'an itself does not offer any warrant for\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis interpretation. In fact, the term qarn (and its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplural qurun) occurs in the Qur'an - apart from the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcombination Dhu 'l-Qarnayn appearing in verses {83}, {86}\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand {94} of this surah - twenty times: and each time it\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas the meaning of \"generation\" in the sense of people\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonging to one particular epoch or civilization.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, since the allegory of Dhu 'l-Qarnayn is meant to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillustrate the qualities of a powerful and just ruler, it\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis possible to assume that this designation is an echo of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above-mentioned ancient symbolism, which - being\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamiliar to the Arabs from very early times-had acquired\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidiomatic currency in their language long before the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadvent of Islam. Within the context of our Qur'anic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegory, the \"two horns\" may be taken to denote the two\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsources of power with which Dhu 'l-Qarnayn is said to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been endowed: namely, the worldly might and prestige\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof kingship as well as the spiritual strength resulting\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom his faith in God. This last point is extremely\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant- for it is precisely the Qur'anic stress on his\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith in God that makes it impossible to identify Dhu\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'l-Qarnayn, as most of the commentators do, with\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAlexander the Great (who is represented on some of his\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoins with two horns on his head) or with one or another\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the pre-Islamic, Himyaritic kings of Yemen. All those\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistoric personages were pagans and worshipped a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tplurality of deities as a matter of course, whereas our\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDhu 'l-Qarnayn is depicted as a firm believer in the One\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod: indeed, it is this aspect of his personality that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovides the innermost reason of the Qur'anic allegory.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWe must, therefore, conclude that the latter has nothing\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto do with history or even legend, and that its sole\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurport is a parabolic discourse on faith and ethics,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith specific reference to the problem of worldly power\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(see the concluding passage in the introductory note to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis surah)."

This\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"identification\" is mainly based on a well-authenticated\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTradition - recorded by Ibn Hanbal, Bukhari and Muslim -\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich tells us that the Apostle of God had a prophetic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdream to which he referred on awakening, with an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texclamation of distress: \"There is no deity save God! Woe\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunto the Arabs from a misfortune that is approaching: a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlittle gap has been opened today in the rampart of Gog\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Magog!\" Ever since the late Middle Ages, Muslims have\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen inclined to discern in this dream a prediction of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe great Mongol invasion in the thirteenth century,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich destroyed the Abbasid Empire and, thus, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpolitical power of the Arabs. However, the mention, in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverses {99-101} of this surah, of \"the Day\" - i.e., the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay of Judgment - in connection with \"Gog and Magog\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshows that \"the time appointed by my Sustainer\" relates\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the coming of the Last Hour, when all works of man\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill be destroyed. But since none of the Qur'anic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferences to the \"approach\" or the \"nearness\" of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Hour has anything to do with the human concept of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, it is possible to accept both of the above\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations as equally valid in the sense that the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"coming of the Last Hour\" comprises an indefinite - and,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin human terms, perhaps even immensely long - span of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime, and that the break-through of the godless forces of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Gog and Magog\" was to be one of the signs of its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproach. And, finally, it is most logical to assume\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(especially on the basis of {21: 96-97}) that the terms\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tYajuj and Majuj are purely allegorical, applying not to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany specific tribes or beings but to a series of social\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcatastrophes which would cause a complete destruction of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's civilization before the coming of the Last Hour."

Legend has it that some young Christians of Ephesus, accompanied by their dog, withdrew into a secluded cave in order to be able to live in accordance with their faith, and remained there, miraculously asleep for a great length of time (according to some accounts, referred to in verse 25 of this surah, for about three centuries). When they finally awoke - unaware of the long time during which they had lain asleep - they sent one of their company to the town to purchase some food. In the meantime the situation had changed entirely: Christianity was no longer persecuted and had even become the official religion of the Roman Empire. The ancient coin (dating from the reign of Decius) with which the young man wanted to pay for his purchases immediately aroused curiosity; people began to question the stranger, and the story of the Men of the Cave and their miraculous sleep came to light.\r\\nAs already mentioned, the majority of the classical commentators rely on this Christian legend in their endeavour to interpret the Qur'anic reference (in verses {9-26}) to the Men of the Cave. It seems, however, that the Christian formulation of this theme is a later development of a much older oral tradition - a tradition which, in fact, goes back to pre-Christian, Jewish sources. This is evident from several well-authenticated ahadith (mentioned by all the classical commentators), according to which it was the Jewish rabbis (ahbar) of Medina who induced the Meccan opponents of Muhammad to \"test his veracity\" by asking him to explain, among other problems, the story of the Men of the Cave.\r\\nReferring to these ahadith, Ibn Kathir remarks in his commentary on verse {13} of this surah: \"It has been said that they were followers of Jesus the son of Mary, but God knows it better: it is obvious that they lived much earlier than the Christian period - for, had they been Christians, why should the Jewish rabbis have been intent on preserving their story, seeing that the Jews had cut themselves off from all friendly communion with them [i.e., the Christians]?\" We may, therefore, safely assume that the legend of the Men of the Cave - stripped of its Christian garb and the superimposed Christian background - is, substantially, of Jewish origin. If we discard the later syncretic additions and reduce the story to its fundamentals - voluntary withdrawal from the world, agelong \"sleep\" in a secluded cave and a miraculous \"awakening\" after an indeterminate period of time - we have before us a striking allegory relating to a movement which played an important role in Jewish religious history during the centuries immediately preceding and following the advent of Jesus: namely, the ascetic Essene Brotherhood (to which, as I have pointed out in note [42] on 3:52, Jesus himself may have belonged), and particularly that of its branches which lived in self-imposed solitude in the vicinity of the Dead Sea and has recently, after the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls, come to be known as the \"Qumran community\". The expression ar-raqim occurring in the above Qur'an-verse (and rendered by me as \"scriptures\") lends strong support to this theory. As recorded by Tabari, some of the earliest authorities - and particularly Ibn 'Abbas - regarded this expression as synonymous with marqum (\"something that is written\") and hence with kitab (\"a writ\" or \"a scripture\"); and Razi adds that \"all rhetoricians and Arabic philologists assert that ar-raqim signifies [the same as] al-kitab\". Since it is historically established that the members of the Qumran community - the strictest group among the Essenes - devoted themselves entirely to the study, the copying and the preservation of the sacred scriptures, and since they lived in complete seclusion from the rest of the world and were highly admired for their piety and moral purity, it is more than probable that their mode of life made so strong an impression on the imagination of their more worldly co-religionists that it became gradually allegorized in the story of the Men of the Cave who \"slept\" – that is, were cut off from the outside world - for countless years, destined to be \"awakened\" after their spiritual task was done.\r\\nBut whatever the source of this legend, and irrespective of whether it is of Jewish or Christian origin, the fact remains that it is used in the Qur'an in a purely parabolic sense: namely, as an illustration of God's power to bring about death (or \"sleep\") and resurrection (or \"awakening'); and, secondly, as an allegory of the piety that induces men to abandon a wicked or frivolous world in order to keep their faith unsullied, and of God's recognition of that faith by His bestowal of a spiritual awakening which transcends time and death.\r\\n"

In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch a social order, material success and power are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusually seen as consequences of a more or less conscious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejection of all metaphysical considerations - and, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular, of all that is comprised in the concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod-willed standards of morality - on the assumption that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey are but an obstacle in the path of man's free,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlimited \"development\". It goes without saying that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattitude (which has reached its epitome in the modern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatement that \"religion is opium for the people\") is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiametrically opposed to the demand, voiced by every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thigher religion, that man's social life, if it is to be a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruly \"good\" life, must be subordinated to definite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tethical principles and restraints.

In his commentary on this passage, Tabari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquotes the following remark of Ibn 'Abbas: \"If [in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst instance] they had sacrificed any cow chosen by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthemselves, they would have fulfilled their duty; but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey made it complicated for themselves, and so God made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit complicated for them.\" A similar view has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed, in the same context, by Zamakhshari. It would\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappear that the moral of this story points to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant problem of all (and, therefore, also of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic) religious jurisprudence: namely, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinadvisability of trying to elicit additional details in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespect of any religious law that had originally been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiven in general terms - for, the more numerous and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmultiform such details become, the more complicated and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trigid becomes the law. This point has been acutely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrasped by Rashid Rida', who says in his commentary on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe above Qur'anic passage (see Manar I, 345 f.): \"Its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlesson is that one should not pursue one's [legal]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinquiries in such a way as to make laws more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplicated.... This was how the early generations [of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims] visualized the problem. They did not make things\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplicated for themselves - and so, for them, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious law (din) was natural, simple and liberal in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits straightforwardness. But those who came later added\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto it [certain other] injunctions which they had deduced\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby means of their own reasoning (ijtihad); and they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmultiplied those [additional] injunctions to such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\textent that the religious law became a heavy burden on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe community.\" For the sociological reason why the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenuine ordinances of Islamic Law - that is, those which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been prima facie laid down as such in the Qur'an and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe teachings of the Prophet - are almost always devoid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof details, I would refer the reader to my book State and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGovernment in Islam (pp. 11 ff. and passim). The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportance of this problem, illustrated in the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory of the cow - and correctly grasped by the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions - explains why this surah has been entitled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"The Cow\".

Neither the Qur'an, nor any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsaying of the Prophet, nor even the Bible offers the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslightest warrant for this highly imaginative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanation, which must, therefore, be rejected - quite\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapart from the fact that the pronoun hu in idribuhu has a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmasculine gender, while the noun nafs (here translated as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"human being\") is feminine in gender: from which it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollows that the imperative idribuhu cannot possibly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefer to nafs. On the other hand, the verb daraba (lit.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"he struck\") is very often used in a figurative or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetonymic sense, as, for instance, in the expression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdaraba fi 'l-ard (\"he journeyed on earth\"), or daraba\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'sh-shay' bi'sh-shay' (\"he mixed one thing with another\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthing\"), or daraba mathal (\"he coined a similitude\" or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"propounded a parable\" or \"gave an illustration\"), or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ala darb wahid (\"similarly applied\" or \"in the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanner\"), or duribat 'alayhim adh-dhillah (\"humiliation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas imposed on them\" or \"applied to them\"), and so forth.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaking all this into account, I am of the opinion that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe imperative idribuhu occurring in the above Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage must be translated as \"apply it\" or \"this\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(referring, in this context, to the principle of communal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility). As for the feminine pronoun ha in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tba'diha (\"some of it\"), it must necessarily relate to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnearest preceding feminine noun - that is, to the nafs\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat has been murdered, or the act of murder itself about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich (fiha) the community disagreed. Thus, the phrase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidribuhu bi-ba'diha may be suitably rendered as \"apply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis [principle] to some of those [cases of unresolved\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmurder]\": for it is obvious that the principle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunal responsibility for murder by a person or persons\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunknown can be applied only to some and not to all such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcases."

The word ayah (\"message\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurring in this context is also used to denote a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"verse\" of the Qur'an (because every one of these verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontains a message). Taking this restricted meaning of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe term ayah, some scholars conclude from the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage that certain verses of the Qur'an have been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"abrogated\" by God's command before the revelation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an was completed. Apart from the fancifulness of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassertion - which calls to mind the image of a human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthor correcting, on second thought, the proofs of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmanuscript, deleting one passage and replacing it with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanother - there does not exist a single reliable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTradition to the effect that the Prophet ever declared a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse of the Qur'an to have been \"abrogated\". At the root\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the so-called \"doctrine of abrogation\" may lie the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinability of some of the early commentators to reconcile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone Qur'anic passage with another: a difficulty which was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tovercome by declaring that one of the verses in question\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad been \"abrogated\". This arbitrary procedure explains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso why there is no unanimity whatsoever among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupholders of the \"doctrine of abrogation\" as to which,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand how many, Qur'an-verses have been affected by it;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, furthermore, as to whether this alleged abrogation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timplies a total elimination of the verse in question from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe context of the Qur'an, or only a cancellation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecific ordinance or statement contained in it. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshort, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" has no basis whatever\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin historical fact, and must be rejected. On the other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thand, the apparent difficulty in interpreting the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic passage disappears immediately if the term ayah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis understood, correctly, as \"message\", and if we read\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis verse in conjunction with the preceding one, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates that the Jews and the Christians refuse to accept\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany revelation which might supersede that of the Bible:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor, if read in this way, the abrogation relates to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearlier divine messages and not to any part of the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself."

It is to be noted that even\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin pre-Islamic times the Ka'bah was associated with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmemory of Abraham, whose personality had always been in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe foreground of Arabian thought. According to very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tancient Arabian traditions, it was at the site of what\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater became Mecca that Abraham, in order to placate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSarah, abandoned his Egyptian bondwoman Hagar and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchild Ishmael after he had brought them there from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCanaan. This is by no means improbable if one bears in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind that for a camel-riding bedouin (and Abraham was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly one) a journey of twenty or even thirty days\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas never been anything out of the ordinary. At first\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tglance, the Biblical statement (Genesis xii, 14) that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas \"in the wilderness of Beersheba\" (i.e., in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsouthernmost tip of Palestine) that Abraham left Hagar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Ishmael would seem to conflict with the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount. This seeming contradiction, however, disappears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas soon as we remember that to the ancient, town-dwelling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHebrews the term \"wilderness of Beersheba\" comprised all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe desert regions south of Palestine, including the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHijaz. It was at the place where they had been abandoned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Hagar and Ishmael, after having discovered the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspring which is now called the Well of Zamzam, eventually\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsettled; and it may have been that very spring which in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime induced a wandering group of bedouin families\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelonging to the South-Arabian (Qahtani) tribe of Jurhum\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto settle there. Ishmael later married a girl of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe, and so became the progenitor of the musta'ribah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"Arabianized\") tribes - thus called on account of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescent from a Hebrew father and a Qahtani mother. As for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham, he is said to have often visited Hagar and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIshmael; and it was on the occasion of one of these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperiodic visits that he, aided by Ishmael, erected the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginal structure of the Ka'bah.

This was not prompted by any specific revelation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut was obviously due to the fact that the Ka'bah -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talthough it had in the meantime been filled with various\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidols to which the pre-Islamic Arabs paid homage - was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways regarded as the first temple ever dedicated to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne God (cf.  3:96 ). Since he was aware of the sanctity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Jerusalem - the other holy centre of the unitarian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaith - the Prophet prayed, as a rule, before the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsouthern wall of the Ka'bah, towards the north, so as to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tface both the Ka'bah and Jerusalem. After the exodus to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMedina he continued to pray northwards, with only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem as his qiblah (direction of prayer). About\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixteen months after his arrival at Medina, however, he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived a revelation (verses {142-150} of this surah)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich definitively established the Ka'bah as the qiblah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the followers of the Qur'an. This \"abandonment\" of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem obviously displeased the Jews of Medina, who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust have felt gratified when they saw the Muslims\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpraying towards their holy city; and it is to them that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe opening sentence of this passage refers. If one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsiders the matter from the historical point of view,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere had never been any change in the divine\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommandments relating to the qiblah: there had simply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen no ordinance whatever in this respect before verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{142-150} were revealed. Their logical connection with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe preceding passages, which deal, in the main, with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham and his creed, lies in the fact that it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbraham who erected the earliest structure of the temple\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich later came to be known as the Ka'bah."

Ibn Kathir, in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary on this verse, stresses its inner resemblance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the phrase occurring in  5:48 : \"unto every one of you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave We appointed a [different] law and way of life\".

By including this kind of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpenditure within the essential acts of piety, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an implies that the freeing of people from bondage -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, thus, the abolition of slavery - is one of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial objectives of Islam. At the time of the revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Qur'an, slavery was an established institution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthroughout the world, and its sudden abolition would have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen economically impossible. In order to obviate this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulty, and at the same time to bring about an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teventual abolition of all slavery, the Qur'an ordains in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 8:67  that henceforth only captives taken in a just war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(jihad) may be kept as slaves. But even with regard to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpersons enslaved in this or - before the revelation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 8:67  - in any other way, the Qur'an stresses the great\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerit inherent in the freeing of slaves, and stipulates\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit as a means of atonement for various transgressions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(see, e.g.,  4:92 ,  5:89 ,  58:3 ).

Just as piety cannot become effective\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout righteous action, individual righteousness cannot\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbecome really effective in the social sense unless there\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis agreement within the community as to the social rights\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand obligations of its members: in other words, as to the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpractical laws which should govern the behaviour of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual within the society and the society's attitude\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards the individual and his actions. This is the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinnermost reason why legislation plays so great a role\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithin the ideology of Islam, and why the Qur'an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsistently intertwines its moral and spiritual\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texhortation with ordinances relating to practical aspects\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof social life. Now one of the main problems facing any\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsociety is the safeguarding of the lives and the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividual security of its members: and so it is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstandable that laws relating to homicide and its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpunishment are dealt with prominently at this place. (It\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould be borne in mind that \"The Cow\" was the first\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurah revealed in Medina, that is, at the time when the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim community had just become established as an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindependent social entity.) As for the term qisas\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurring at the beginning of the above passage, it must\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe pointed out that - according to all the classical\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators - it is almost synonymous with musawah,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ti.e., \"making a thing equal [to another thing]\": in this\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance, making the punishment equal (or appropriate) to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe crime - a meaning which is best rendered as \"just\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tretribution\" and not (as has been often, and erroneously,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdone) as \"retaliation\". Seeing that the Qur'an speaks\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there of \"cases of killing\" (fi 'l-qatla, lit., \"in the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmatter of the killed\") in general, and taking into\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccount that this expression covers all possible cases of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomicide - premeditated murder, murder under extreme\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovocation, culpable homicide, accidental manslaughter,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand so forth - it is obvious that the taking of a life\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor a life (implied in the term \"retaliation\") would not\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin every case correspond to the demands of equity. (This\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been made clear, for instance, in  4:92 , where legal\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trestitution for unintentional homicide is dealt with.)\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRead in conjunction with the term \"just retribution\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich introduces this passage, it is clear that the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulation \"the free for the free, the slave for the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslave, the woman for the woman\" cannot - and has not been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintended to - be taken in its literal, restrictive sense:\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor this would preclude its application to many cases of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomicide, e.g., the killing of a free man by a slave, or\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a woman by a man, or vice-versa. Thus, the above\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstipulation must be regarded as an example of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telliptical mode of expression (ijaz) so frequently\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temployed in the Qur'an, and can have but one meaning,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely: \"if a free man has committed the crime, the free\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman must be punished; if a slave has committed the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrime...\", etc. - in other words, whatever the status of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe guilty person, he or she (and he or she alone) is to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe punished in a manner appropriate to the crime."

That this early, fundamental principle of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself-defence as the only possible justification of war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thas been maintained throughout the Qur'an is evident from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 60:8 , as well as from the concluding sentence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 4:91 , both of which belong to a later period than the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove verse."

Most of the commentators see in this sentence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan indication of a conscious intent on the part of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson thus described; but it is also possible that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticle li in li-yufsida (generally taken to mean \"in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder that he might spread corruption\") plays in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext the role of what the grammarians call a lam\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'aqibah, \"the [letter] lam used to denote a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequence\" - i.e., regardless of the existence or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-existence of a conscious intent. (By rendering the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence the way I do it, both possibilities are left\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topen.) As regards the expression harth (rendered by me as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"tilth\"), its primary significance is \"gain\" or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"acquisition\" through labour; and thus it often signifies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"worldly goods\" (see Lane II, 542), and especially the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcrops obtained by tilling land, as well as the tilled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tland itself. If harth is understood in this context as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"tilth\", it would apply, metaphorically, to human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendeavours in general, and to social endeavours in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticular. However, some commentators - basing their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion on the Qur'anic sentence, \"your wives are your\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttilth\" ( 2:223 )- maintain that harth stands here for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"wives\" (cf. Razi, and the philologist Al-Azhari, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquoted in Manar II, 248): in which case the \"destruction\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof tilth and progeny\" would be synonymous with an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupsetting of family life and, consequently, of the entire\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocial fabric. According to either of these two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations, the passage has the following meaning:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAs soon as the mental attitude described above is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerally accepted and made the basis of social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, it unavoidably results in widespread moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdecay and, consequently, social disintegration."

What is alluded to in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse is no more than the relative homogeneity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstinctive perceptions and inclinations characteristic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof man's primitive mentality and the primitive social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torder in which he lived in those early days. Since that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thomogeneity was based on a lack of intellectual and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temotional differentiation rather than on a conscious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tagreement among the members of human society, it was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbound to disintegrate in the measure of man's subsequent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelopment. As his thought-life became more and more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplex, his emotional capacity and his individual needs,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo, became more differentiated, conflicts of views and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterests came to the fore, and mankind ceased to be \"one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsingle community\" as regards their outlook on life and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir moral valuations: and it was at this stage that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdivine guidance became necessary.

There exist a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of highly-authenticated Traditions to the effect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the wife of Thabit ibn Qays, Jamilah, came to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet and demanded a divorce from her husband on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tground that, in spite of his irreproachable character and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbehaviour, she \"disliked him as she would dislike falling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinto unbelief after having accepted Islam\".

(Several variants of this Tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been recorded by Bukhari, Nasa'i, Tirmidhi, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMajah and Bayhaqi, on the authority of Ibn 'Abbas.)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSimilar Traditions, handed down on the authority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'A'ishah and relating to a woman called Hubaybah bint\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSahl, are to be found in the Muwatta' of Imam Malik, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Musnad of Imam Ahmad, and in the compilations of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNasa'i and Abu Da'ud (in one variant, the latter gives\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe woman's name as Hafsah bint Sahl). In accordance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese Traditions, Islamic Law stipulates that whenever a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage is dissolved at the wife's instance without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffence on the part of the husband against his marital\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligations, the wife is the contract-breaking party and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmust, therefore, return the dower which she received from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim at the time of concluding the marriage: and in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevent \"there shall be no sin upon either of them\" if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thusband takes back the dower which the wife gives up of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ther own free will. An exhaustive discussion of all these\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions and their legal implications is found in Nayl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Awtar VII, pp. 34-41.

Hence, if one is really\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintent on understanding the Qur’anic message, one must\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeware of a \"hasty approach\" - that is to say, of drawing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thasty conclusions from isolated verses or sentences taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of their context - but should, rather, allow the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole of the Qur'an to be revealed to one’s mind before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattempting to interpret singe aspects of its message.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(See also {75:16-19} and the corresponding notes.)"

According to this story,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta flock of sheep strayed at night into a neighbouring\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfield and destroyed its crop.  The case was brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore King David for judicial decision. On finding that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe incident was due to the negligence of the owner of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sheep, David awarded the whole flock - the value of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich corresponded roughly to the extent of the damage -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas an indemnity to the owner of the field.  David's young\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tson, Solomon, regarded this judgement as too severe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinasmuch as the sheep represented the defendant's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcapital, whereas the damage was of a transitory nature,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvolving no more than the loss of one year's crop, i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof income.  He therefore suggested to his father that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjudgement should be altered: the owner of the field\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould have the temporary possession and usufruct of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsheep (sheep, wool, new-born lambs, etc.), while their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towner should tend the damaged field until it was restored\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto its former productivity, whereupon both the field and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe flock of sheep would revert to their erstwhile\\n\\t\\t\\t\\towners; in this way the plaintiff would be fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompensated for his loss without depriving the defendant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof his substance.  David realized taht his son'd solution\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the case was better than his own, and passed judgement\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordingly; but since he, no less than Solomon, had been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinspired by a deep sense of justice, God - in the words\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Qur'an - \"bore witness to their judgement\"."

The concluding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trhetorical question, \"but are you grateful [for this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tboon]?\" implies that, as a rule, man does not fully\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trealize - and, hence, is not really grateful for- the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritual bounty thus offered him by God."

As a matter of fact, the Qur'an uses the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression in three other places with reference to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreation of man in general - namely in {15 :29} and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 38:72 , \"when I have formed him... and breathed into him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof My spirit\"; and in  32:9 , \"and thereupon He forms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[lit., \"formed\"] him fully and breathes [lit.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"breathed\"] into him of His spirit\". In particular, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage of which the last-quoted phrase is a part (i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{32:7-9}) makes it abundantly and explicitly clear that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod \"breathes of His spirit\" into every human being.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCommenting on the verse under consideration, Zamakhshari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstates that \"the breathing of the spirit [of God] into a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbody signifies the endowing it with life\": an explanation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith which Razi concurs. (In this connection, see also\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnote [181] on  4:171 .) As for the description of Mary as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallati ahsanat farjaha, idiomatically denoting \"one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tguarded her chastity\" (lit., \"her private parts\"), it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be borne in mind that the term ihsan - lit., \"[one's]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing fortified [against any danger or evil]\" - has the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttropical meaning of \"abstinence from what is unlawful or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treprehensible\" (Tarj al-'Arus), and especially from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tillicit sexual intercourse, and is applied to a man as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as a woman: thus, for instance, the terms muhsan and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuhsanah are used elsewhere in the Qur'an to describe,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trespectively, a man or a woman who is \"fortified [by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage] against unchastity\". Hence, the expression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallati ahsanat farjaha, occurring in the above verse as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as in {66: 12} with reference to Mary, is but meant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto stress her outstanding chastity and complete\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabstinence, in thought as well as in deed, from anything\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunlawful or morally reprehensible: in other words, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trejection of the calumny (referred to in  4:156  and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobliquely alluded to in {19:27-28}) that the birth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJesus was the result of an \"illicit union\"."

On the basis of this interpretation, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticle aw which precedes this clause does not denote an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplanatory amplification, more or less analgous to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is, those whom they rightfully possess [through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"for him who has the will to take thought - that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)"

Hence, I prefer to base my rendering on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation advanced and convincingly argued by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTabari, who regards the crucial particle ma not as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnegation but as a relative pronoun synonymous with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talladhi (\"that which\" or \"whatever\"), and understands the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnoun khirah in its primary significance of \"that which is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchosen\" or \"preferred\", i.e., because it is considered to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe the best: in another word, as a synonym of khayr.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZamakhshari refers to this interpretation with evident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproval (without, however, mentioning Tabari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecifically), and enlarges upon it thus: \"God chooses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor mankind whatever is best (ma hawa khayr) and most\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeneficial (aslah) for them, for He knows better than\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey themselves do what is good for them.\""

Since, however, the pronoun \"it\" relates here to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an, the metaphorical expression \"between its hands\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor \"before it\" cannot possibly refer to \"knowledge\" (as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit does in  2:255 ), but must obviously refer to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobjective reality with which the Qur'an is \"confronted\":\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat is, something that was coexistent in time with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevelation of the Qur'an. Now this, taken together (a)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith the fact - frequently stressed in the Qur'an and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsince established by objective scholarship - that in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcourse of the millennia the Bible has been subjected to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsiderable and often arbitrary alteration, and (b) with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fact that many of the laws enunciated in the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiffer from the laws of the Bible, brings us forcibly to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe conclusion that the \"confirmation\" of the latter by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an can refer only to the basic truths still\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscernible in the Bible, and not to its time-bound\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlegislation or to its present text - in other words, a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfirmation of whatever was extant of its basic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteachings at the time of the revelation of the Qur'an:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand it is this that the phrase ma bayna yadayhi expresses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin this context as well as in  5:46  and {48} or in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 61:6  (where it refers to Jesus' confirming the truth of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"whatever there still remained [i.e., in his lifetime] of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Torah\")."

Tabari identifies the ayat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuhkamat (\"messages that are clear in and by themselves\")\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith what the philologists and jurists describe as nass -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely, ordinances or statements which are self-evident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(zahir) by virtue of their wording (cf. Lisan al-'Arab,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tart. nass). Consequently, Tabari regards as ayat muhkamat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly those statements or ordinances of the Qur'an which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdo not admit of more than one interpretation (which does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot, of course, preclude differences of opinion regarding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe implications of a particular ayah muhkamah). In my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\topinion, however, it would be too dogmatic to regard any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage of the Qur'an which does not conform to the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinition as mutashabih (\"allegorical\"): for there are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany statements in the Qur'an which are liable to more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan one interpretation but are, nevertheless, not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegorical - just as there are many expressions and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassages which, despite their allegorical formulation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treveal to the searching intellect only one possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning. For this reason, the ayat mutashabihat may be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefined as those passages of the Qur'an which are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed in a figurative manner, with a meaning that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetaphorically implied but not directly, in so many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, stated. The ayat muhkamat are described as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"essence of the divine writ\" (umm al-kitab) because they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomprise the fundamental principles underlying its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage and, in particular, its ethical and social\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteachings: and it is only on the basis of these clearly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenunciated principles that the allegorical passages can\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbe correctly interpreted.

    "Body": "This reference to the battle of Uhud, to which many verses of this surah are devoted, connects with the exhortation implied in the preceding verse, \"if you are patient in adversity and conscious of God, their guile cannot harm you at all\". Since this and the subsequent references cannot be fully understood without a knowledge of the historical background, a brief account of the battle would seem to be indicated. In order to avenge their catastrophic defeat at Badr in the second year after the hijrah, the pagan Meccans - supported by several tribes hostile to the Muslims - mustered in the following year an army comprising ten thousand men under the command of Abu Sufyan and marched against Medina. On hearing of their approach, in the month of Shawwal 3 H., the Prophet held a council of war at which the tactics to be adopted were discussed. In view of the overwhelming cavalry forces at the disposal of the enemy, the Prophet himself was of the opinion that the Muslims should give battle from behind the fortifications of Medina and, if need be, fight in its narrow streets and lanes; and his plan was supported by some of the most outstanding among his Companions. However, the majority of the Muslim leaders who participated in the council strongly insisted on going forth and meeting the enemy in the open field. In obedience to the Qur'anic principle that all communal affairs must be transacted on the basis of mutually-agreed decisions (see verse 159 of this surah, as well as 42 : 38), the Prophet sorrowfully gave way to the will of the majority and set out with his followers towards the plain below the mountain of Uhud, a little over three miles from Medina. His army consisted of less than one thousand men; but on the way to Mount Uhud this number was still further reduced by the defection of some three hundred men led by the hypocritical 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, who pretended to be convinced that the Muslims did not really intend to fight. Shortly before the battle, two other groups from among the Prophet's forces - namely, the clans of Banu Salamah (of the tribe of Al-Aws) and Banu Harithah (of the tribe of Khazraj) almost lost heart and were about to join the defectors (3 : 122) on the plea that because of their numerical weakness the Muslims must now avoid giving battle; but at the last moment they decided to follow the Prophet. Having less than seven hundred men with him, the Prophet arrayed the bulk of his forces with their backs to the mountain and posted all his archers - numbering fifty - on a nearby hill in order to provide cover against an outflanking manoeuvre by the enemy cavalry; these archers were ordered not to leave their post under any circumstances. In their subsequent, death-defying assault upon the greatly superior forces of the pagan Quraysh, the Muslims gained a decisive advantage over the former and almost routed them. At that moment, however, most of the archers, believing that the battle had been won and fearing lest they lose their share of the spoils, abandoned their covering position and joined the melee around the encampment of the Quraysh. Seizing this opportunity, the bulk of the Meccan cavalry under the command of Khalid ibn al-Walid (who shortly after this battle embraced Islam and later became one of the greatest Muslim generals of all times) veered round in a wide arc and attacked the Muslim forces from the rear. Deprived of the cover of the archers, and caught between two fires, the Muslims retreated in disorder, with the loss of many lives. The Prophet himself and a handful of his most stalwart Companions defended themselves desperately; and the Prophet was seriously injured and fell to the ground. The cry immediately arose, \"The Apostle of God has been killed!\" Many of the Muslims began to flee; some among them were even prepared to throw themselves upon the mercy of the enemy. But a few of the Companions - among them 'Umar ibn al-Khattab and Talhah - called out, \"What good are your lives without him, O believers? Let us die as he has died!\" - and threw themselves with the strength of despair against the Meccans. Their example at once found an echo among the rest of the Muslims, who in the meantime had learnt that the Prophet was alive: they rallied and counter-attacked the enemy, and thus saved the day. But the Muslims were now too exhausted to exploit their chances of victory, and the battle ended in a draw, with the enemy retreating in the direction of Mecca. On the next day the Prophet started in pursuit of them at the head of seventy of his Companions. But when the Muslims reached the place called Hamra' al-Asad, about eight miles south of Medina, it became obvious that the Meccans were in no mood to risk another encounter and were rapidly marching home; and thereupon the tiny Muslim army returned to Medina.

The defeats and victories\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspoken of above relate to the last phases of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies-long struggle between the Byzantine and Persian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tEmpires. During the early years of the seventh century\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Persians conquered parts of Syria and Anatolia, \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlands close-by\", i.e., near the heartland of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tByzantine Empire; in 613 they took Damascus, and in 614,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJerusalem; Egypt fell to them in 615-16, and at the same\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime they laid siege to Constantinople itself.

The pagan Quraysh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the other hand, sympathized with Persians who, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthought, would vindicate their own opposition to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne-God idea. When Muhammad enunciated the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an-verses predicting a Byzantine victory \"within a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfew years\", this prophecy was received with derision by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Quraysh.

    "Body": "This is the earliest mention of the term and concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\triba in the chronology of Qur'anic revelation. In its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral, linguistic sense, this term denotes an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"addition\" to or an \"increase\" of a thing over and above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits original size or amount; in the terminology of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an, it signifies any unlawful addition, by way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest, to a sum of money or goods lent by one person\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor body of persons to another. Considering the problem in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterms of the economic conditions prevailing at or before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir time, most of the early Muslim jurists identified\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis \"unlawful addition\" with profits obtained through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany kind of interest-bearing loans irrespective of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trate of interest and the economic motivation involved.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tWith all this - as is evidenced by the voluminous\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjuridical literature on this subject - Islamic scholars\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave not yet been able to reach an absolute agreement on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe definition of riba: a definition, that is, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould cover all conceivable legal situations and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpositively respond to all the exigencies of a variable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomic environment. In the words of Ibn Kathir (in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary on  2:275 ), \"the subject of riba is one of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most difficult subjects for many of the scholars (ahl\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'ilm)\". It should be borne in mind that the passage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcondemning and prohibiting riba in legal terms\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t({2:275-281}) was the last revelation received by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, who died a few days later (cf. note [268] on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 2:281 ; hence, the Companions had no opportunity to ask\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim about the shar'i implications of the relevant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjunction - so much so that even 'Umar ibn al-Khattab is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treliably reported to have said: \" The last [of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an] that was revealed was the passage [lit., \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse\"] on riba; and, behold, the Apostle of God passed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taway without [lit., \"before\"] having explained its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning to us\" (Ibn Hanbal, on the authority of Sa'id ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Musayyab). Nevertheless, the severity with which the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an condemns riba and those who practice it furnishes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- especially when viewed against the background of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmankind's economic experiences during the intervening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies - a sufficiently clear indication of its nature\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand its social as well as moral implications. Roughly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeaking, the opprobrium of riba (in the sense in which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis term is used in the Qur'an and in many sayings of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet) attaches to profits obtained through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterest-bearing loans involving an exploitation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\teconomically weak by the strong and resourceful: an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texploitation characterized by the fact that the lender,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile retaining full ownership of the capital loaned and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thaving no legal concern with the purpose for which it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be used or with the manner of its use, remains\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontractually assured of gain irrespective of any losses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich the borrower may suffer in conseqence of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransaction. With this definition in mind, we realize\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the question as to what kinds of financial\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttransactions fall within the category of riba is, in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlast resort, a moral one, closely connected with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocio-economic motivation underlying the mutual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelationship of borrower and lender; and, stated in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurely economic terms, it is a question as to how profits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand risks may be equitably shared by both partners to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tloan transaction. It is, of course, impossible to answer\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis double question in a rigid, once-for-all manner: our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanswers must necessarily vary in accordance with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchanges to which man's social and technological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdevelopment - and, thus, his economic environment - is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubject. Hence, while the Qur'anic condemnation of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept and practice of riba is unequivocal and final,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery successive Muslim generation is faced with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchallenge of giving new dimensions and a fresh economic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning to this term which, for want of a better word,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmay be rendered as \"usury\". - In the present instance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(which, as I have mentioned, is the earliest in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistory of the Qur'an), no clear-cut prohibition is as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyet laid down; but the prohibition appearing in  2:275 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tff. is already foreshadowed by the reference to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmoral hope of increasing one's own substance \"through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[other] people's"

The Prophet himself is reported to have said:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"None of you has real faith unless I am dearer unto him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan his father, and his child, and all mankind\" (Bukhari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Muslim, on the authority of Anas, with several almost\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidentical versions in other compilations).

At the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstigation of the Jewish tribe of Banu 'n-Nadir, who had\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen expelled from Yathrib (Medina) after they had broken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe treaty binding them to the Muslims, several of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost powerful Abrabian tribes formed a confederacy with a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview to overcoming, once and for all, the threat posed by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslam to the beliefs and many of the customs of pagan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabia. In the month of Shawwal, 5 H., a force of well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tover 12,000 men, composed of the Quraysh and their allies\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- the Banu Kinanah, Banu Asad and the people of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoastlands (the Tihamah), as well as the great Najdi\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribe of Ghatafan and its allies, the Hawazin (or Banu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Amir) and Banu Sulaym - converged upon Medina.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tForewarned of their coming, the Prophet had ordered a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeep trench to be dug around the town - a defensive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeasure unknown in pre-Islamic Arabia - and thus brought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe assault of the Confederates to a halt.

Nevertheless, during a siege lasting\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral weeks all the attempts of the latter to cross the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrench - manned by the numerically much weaker and less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell-armed Muslims - were repulsed with heavy losses to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe attackers; dissensions, based on mutual distrust,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgradually undermined the much-vaunted alliance between\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Jewish and the pagan Arab tribes; in the month of Dhu\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'l-Qa'dah their frustration became complete when a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbitterly-cold stormwind raged for several days, making\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife unbearable even for hardened warriors.

Several years before Muhammad's call to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophethood, his wife Khadijah made him a present of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyoung slave, Zayd ibn Harithah, a descendant of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNorth-Arabian tribe of Banu Kalb, who had been taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcaptive as a child in the course of one of the many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttribal wars and then sold into slavery at Mecca. As soon\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas he became the boy's owner, Muhammad freed him, and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshortly afterwards adopted him as his son; and Zayd, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this turn, was among the first to embrace Islam. Years\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlater, impelled by the desire to break down the ancient\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabian prejudice against a slave's or even a freedman's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarrying a \"free-born\" woman, the Prophet persuaded Zayd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto marry his (Muhammad's) own cousin, Zaynab bint Jahsh,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho, without his being aware of it, had been in love with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuhammad ever since her childhood. Hence, she consented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the proposed marriage with great reluctance, and only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin deference to the authority of the Prophet. Since Zayd,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttoo, was not at all keen on this alliance (being already\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappily married to another freed slave, Umm Ayman, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmother of his son Usamah), it was not surprising that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage did not bring happiness to either Zaynab or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tZayd.

    "Body": "The story which, according to the oldest sources at our\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisposal, is alluded to in verses {21-26} affects the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquestion as to whether God's elect, the prophets - all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhom were endowed, like David, with \"wisdom and sagacity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin judgment\" - could or could not ever commit a sin: in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother words, whether they, too, were originally subject\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the weaknesses inherent in human nature as such or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere a priori endowed with an essential purity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcharacter which rendered each of them \"incapable of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsinning\" (ma'sum). In the form in which it has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thanded down from the earliest authorities (including,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to Tabari and Baghawi, Companions like 'Abd\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAllah ibn'Abbas and Anas ibn Malik, as well as several of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most prominent of their immediate successors), the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory contradicts the doctrine - somewhat arbitrarily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeveloped by Muslim theologians in the course of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcenturies - that prophets cannot sin by virtue of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvery nature, and tends to show that their purity and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsubsequent sinlessness is a result of inner struggles and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrials and, thus, represents in each case a moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tachievement rather than an inborn quality. As narrated in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome detail by Tabari and other early commentators, David\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfell in love with a beautiful woman whom he accidentally\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobserved from his roof terrace. On inquiring, he was told\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat she was the wife of one of his officers, named\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUriah. Impelled by his passion, David ordered his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfield-commander to place Uriah in a particularly exposed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbattle position, where he would be certain to be killed;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand as soon as his order was fulfilled and Uriah died,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid married the widow (who subsequently became the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmother of Solomon). This story agrees more or less with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Old Testament, which gives the woman's name as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBath-Sheba (II Samuel xi), barring the Biblical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegation that David committed adultery with her before\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUriah's death (ibid. xi, 4-5) - an allegation which has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways been rejected by Muslims as highly offensive and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslanderous: cf. the saying of the fourth Caliph, 'Ali ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAbi Talib (quoted by Zamakhshari on the authority of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSa'id ibn al-Musayyab): \"If anyone should narrate the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstory of David in the manner in which the story-tellers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnarrate it, I will have him flogged with one hundred and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsixty stripes - for this is a [suitable] punishment for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslandering prophets\" (thus indirectly recalling the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic ordinance, in  24:4 , which stipulates flogging\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith eighty stripes for accusing ordinary persons of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadultery without legal proof). According to most of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators, the two \"litigants\" who suddenly appeared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore David were angels sent to bring home to him his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin. It is possible, however, to see in their appearance\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan allegory of David's own realization of having sinned:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tvoices of his own conscience which at last \"surmounted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe walls\" of the passion that had blinded him for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttime."

As to the operative verb yatawaffa, it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprimarily denotes \"He takes [something] away in full\";\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand because death is characterized by a disappearance of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall vital impulses (the \"soul\") from the once-living body\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- their being \"taken away in full\", as it were - this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform of the verb has been used tropically, since time\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmemorial, in the sense of \"causing to die\", and (in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintransitive form) \"dying\" or (as a noun) \"death\": a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusage invariably adhered to in the Qur'an. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttraditional likening of sleep to death is due to the fact\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat in both cases the body appears to be devoid of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciousness, partially and temporarily in the former\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcase, and completely and permanently in the latter. (The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpopular translation of anfus-pl. of nafs - as \"souls\" is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly inappropriate in the above context, since,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to the fundamental teaching of the Qur'an,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's soul does not \"die\" at the time of his bodily death\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut, on the contrary, lives on indefinitely.

My rendering of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnafs, in this context, as \"living entity\" follows the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame reasoning. - As regards the expression zawjaha (\"its\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmate\"), it is to be noted that, with reference to animate\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeings, the term zawj (\"a pair\", \"one of a pair\" or \"a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmate\") applies to the male as well as to the female\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomponent of a pair or couple; hence, with reference to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman beings, it signifies a woman's mate (husband) as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as a man's mate (wife). Abu Muslim - as quoted by\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tRazi - interprets the phrase \"He created out of it\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(minha) its mate\" as meaning \"He created its mate [i.e.,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tits sexual counterpart] out of its own kind (min\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjinsiha)\", thus supporting the view of Muhammad 'Abduh\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferred to above. The literal translation of minha as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"out of it\" clearly alludes, in conformity with the text,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the biological fact that both sexes have originated\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom \"one living entity\"."

According to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation suggested by 'A'ishah, the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidow, this refers to the (hypothetical) case of orphan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgirls whom their guardians might wish to marry without,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, being prepared or able to give them an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tappropriate marriage-portion - the implication being that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey should avoid the temptation of committing such an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinjustice and should marry other women instead (cf.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBukhari, Kitab at-Tafsir, as well as Muslim and Nasa'i).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHowever, not all of 'A'ishah's contemporaries subscribed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto her explanation of this verse.

It is obvious that the phrase \"two, or\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthree, or four: but if you have reason to fear...\", etc.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis a parenthetic clause relating to both the free women\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned in the first part of the sentence and to female\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tslaves - for both these nouns are governed by the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timperative verb \"marry\". Thus, the whole sentence has\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis meaning: \"Marry from among [other] women such as are\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlawful to you, or [from among] those whom you rightfully\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossess - [even] two, or three, or four: but if you have\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason to fear that you might not be able to treat them\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith equal fairness, then [only] one\" - implying that,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tirrespective of whether they are free women or,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toriginally, slaves, the number of wives must not exceed\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfour. It was in this sense that Muhammad 'Abduh\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunderstood the above verse (see Manar IV, 350). This view\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis, moreover, supported by verse {25} of this surah as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as by  24:32 , where marriage with female slaves is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspoken of. Contrary to the popular view and the practice\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof many Muslims in the past centuries, neither the Qur'an\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnor the life-example of the Prophet provides any sanction\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor sexual intercourse without marriage. As regards the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpermission to marry more than one wife (up to the maximum\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof four), it is so restricted by the condition, \"if you\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave reason to fear that you might not be able to treat\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem with equal fairness, then [marry only] one\", as to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmake such plural marriages possible only in quite\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texceptional cases and under exceptional circumstances\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(see also the first clause of  24:32  and the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcorresponding note [42]). Still, one might ask why the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame latitude has not been given to women as well; but\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe answer is simple. Notwithstanding the spiritual\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfactor of love which influences the relations between man\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand woman, the determinant biological reason for the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsexual urge is, in both sexes, procreation: and whereas a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman can, at one time, conceive a child from one man\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly and has to carry it for nine months before she can\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconceive another, a man can beget a child every time he\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcohabits with a woman. Thus, while nature would have been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely wasteful if it had produced a polygamous instinct\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin woman, man's polygamous inclination is biologically\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustified. It is, of course, obvious that the biological\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfactor is only one - and by no means always the most\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timportant - of the aspects of marital love: nonetheless, it is a basic factor and, therefore, decisive in the institution of marriage as such. With the wisdom that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talways takes human nature fully into account, Islamic Law\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tundertakes no more than the safeguarding of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsocio-biological function of marriage (which includes\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso care of the progeny), allowing a man to have more\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthan one wife and not allowing a woman to have more than\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone husband at one time; while the spiritual problem of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage, being imponderable and therefore outside the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tscope of law, is left to the discretion of the partners.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIn any event - since marriage in Islam is a purely civil\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontract - recourse to divorce is always open to either\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the two partners. (Regarding the dissolution of a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmarriage at the wife's instance, see surah {2}, note\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[218].)"

This formulation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, has baffled many a commentator: for, if taken\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliterally, it would imply that wrongful profits from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrading based on mutual agreement are excepted from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgeneral prohibition, \"Devour not one another's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions wrongfully\" - a supposition impossible to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaintain in view of the ethics postulated by the Qur'an.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo obviate this difficulty, most of the commentators\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpress the opinion that the particle illa has in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext the meaning of \"but\", and that the clause ought\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto be understood as follows: \"but it is lawful for you to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprofit from one another's possessions by way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlegitimate trade based on mutual agreement\". However,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquite apart from the fact that this interpretation is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thighly laboured and artificial, it does not explain why\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"legitimate trade\" should have been singled out here as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsole means of lawfully deriving economic benefits from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone another - for, as Razi rightly points out in his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentary on this verse, \"it is no less lawful to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbenefit economically through a gift, a bequest, a legal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance, alms, a dower, or an indemnity for injuries\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived: for there are, aside from trade, many ways of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacquiring possessions [lawfully]\". Why, then, should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade alone have been stressed? - and, moreover, stressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin a context not particularly devoted to matters of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade? A really satisfactory answer to this puzzle can,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin my opinion, be obtained only through a linguistic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsideration of the particle illa. Apart from its usual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconnotation of \"except\" or \"unless it be\", it has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsometimes - as has been pointed out in both Qamus and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMughni - the meaning of the simple conjunction \"and\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(wa); similarly, if it is preceded by a negative clause,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit can be synonymous with \"nor\" or \"and neither\" (wa-la):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas, for instance, in {27:10-11}, \"no fear need the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessage-bearers have in My Presence, and neither (illa)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneed he who...\", etc. Now if we apply this particular use\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof illa to the passage under consideration, we arrive at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reading, \"nor [shall you do it] by means of trade\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbased on mutual agreement\", or simply, \"not even by way\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof trade based on mutual agreement\" - whereupon the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning immediately becomes obvious: the believers are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprohibited from devouring another person's possessions\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrongfully even if that other person - being the weaker\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparty - agrees to such a deprivation or exploitation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunder the stress of circumstances. The reading adopted by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tme logically connects, moreover, with verse {32}, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadmonishes the believers not to covet one another's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossessions."

It is, of course, true that the Qur'an forbids\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe use of intoxicants at all times, and not merely at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe time of prayer; but since \"man has been created weak\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t( 4:28 ), his lapse from the way of virtue is always a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility: and it is to prevent him from adding the sin\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof praying while in a state of drunkenness to the sin of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusing intoxicants as such that the above verse was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpromulgated. Moreover, the expression \"while you are in a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of drunkenness (sukara)\" does not apply exclusively\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto alcoholic intoxication, since the term sukr, in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twider connotation, signifies any state of mental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisequilibrium which prevents man from making full use of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this intellectual faculties: that is to say, it can apply\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talso to a temporary clouding of the intellect by drugs or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgiddiness or passion, as well as to the state\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetaphorically described as \"drunk with sleep\" - in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrief, to any condition in which normal judgment is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconfused or suspended.

In the two instances where this verb\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurs in the Qur'an (in this verse as well as in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 8:65 ), it has the imperative form: \"Render the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers free of all disquietude of mind\" or tropically,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"of all fear of death\" - and may, thus, be suitably\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed as \"inspire the believers to overcome all fear\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof death\".

    "Body": "The term inath (which is the plural of untha, \"a female\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing\") seems to have been applied by the pre-Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tArabs to their idols, probably because most of them were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered to be female. Hence, according to some\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphilologists, the plural form inath signifies \"inanimate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthings\" (cf. Lane I, 112). Ibn 'Abbas, Qatadah and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Hasan al Basri explain it as denoting anything that is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassive and lifeless (Tabari); this definition has been\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadopted by Raghib as well. On the other hand, Tabari\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentions a Tradition, on the authority of 'Urwah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to which a copy of the Qur'an in the possession\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof 'A'ishah contained the word awthan (\"idols\") instead\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof inath (cf. also Zamakhshari and Ibn Kathir). The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trendering \"lifeless symbols\" is most appropriate in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontext inasmuch as it adequately combines the concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"idols\" with that of \"inanimate things\"."

As regards the expression, \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsoul from Him\" or \"created by Him\", it is to be noted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat among the various meanings which the word ruh bears\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the Qur'an (e.g., \"inspiration\" in  2:87  and {253]),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is also used in its primary significance of \"breath of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife\", \"soul\", or \"spirit\": thus, for instance, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 32:9 , where the ever-recurring evolution of the human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tembryo is spoken of: \"and then He forms him [i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman]...and breathes into him of His spirit\" - that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendows him with a conscious soul which represents God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupreme gift to man and is, therefore, described as \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreath of His spirit\".

In his commentary on the verse which we are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnow considering, Baydawi states explicitly that the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"bearing\" of God's throne of almightiness (al-'arsh - see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnote [43] on  7:54 ) must be understood in a metaphorical\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsense: \"Their carrying it and surrounding it [or \"being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnear it\"] is a metaphor of their being mindful of it and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacting in accordance therewith (majaz 'an hifzihim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twa-tadbirihim lahu), or a metonym (kinayah) for their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcloseness to the Lord of the Throne, their dignity in His\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsight, and their being instrumental in the realization of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHis will.\" My rendering of the above verse reflects\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBaydawi's interpretation. - As regards the beings which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tare said to be close to the throne of God's almightiness,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost of the classical commentators obviously basing their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview on the symbolic image of \"the angels surrounding the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrone of [God's] almightiness\" on the Day of Judgment\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t( 39:75 ) - think in this instance, too, exclusively of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tangels. But whereas it cannot be denied that the present\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse refers also to angels, it does not follow that it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trefers exclusively to them. In its abstract connotation,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verb hamala frequently signifies \"he bore [or \"took\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tupon himself\"] the responsibility [for something]\": and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso it is evident that it applies here not only to angels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut also to all human beings who are conscious of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttremendous implications of the concept of God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talmightiness, and hence feel morally responsible for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttranslating this consciousness into the reality of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\town and their fellow-beings' lives."

Since,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, the common denominator in all the possible\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings of the term amr - e.g., \"command\", \"injunction\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"ordinance\", \"matter [of concern]\", \"event\", \"action\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tetc. - is the element of purpose, whether implied or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texplicit, we may safely assume that this is the meaning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the term in the above elliptic phrase, which obviously\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talludes to the purpose underlying all divine revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand, consequently, man's faith in it. Now from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttotality of the Qur'anic teachings it becomes apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the innermost purpose of all true faith is, firstly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta realization of the existence of God and of every human\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing's responsibility to Him; secondly, man's attaining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a consciousness of his own dignity as a positive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\telement - a logically necessary element - in God's plan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof creation and, thus, achieving freedom from all manner\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof superstitions and irrational fears; and, lastly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking man aware that whatever good or evil he does is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut done for the benefit, or to the detriment, of his own\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself (as expressed in verse {15} above)."

Consequently, the term \"salvation\" - which I am\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusing here for want of a better word - does not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tadequately convey the full meaning of salam. Its nearest\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tequivalents in Western languages would be the German Heil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor the French salut, both of which express the idea of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspiritual peace and fulfilment without being necessarily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(i.e., linguistically) connected with the Christian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine of salvation."

We have,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, positive evidence of the fact that several of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe most outstanding Companions of the Prophet - 'Ali,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas, 'A'ishah and Mu'adh ibn Jabal - read the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords in question in the spelling hal tastati' rabbaka,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich might be rendered as \"Couldst thou prevail upon thy\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSustainer?\" (Tabari, Zamakhshari, Baghawi, Razi, Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tKathir): a reading which implies the disciples'\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuncertainty as to Jesus' ability (in the spiritual sense\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this word) to make the above request of God. Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'A'ishah, refusing to accept the more common reading hal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyastati' rabbuka (\"can\" or \"could thy Sustainer\"), is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treported to have said: \"The disciples of Jesus knew\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetter than to ask whether God is able to do anything:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey merely asked [of Jesus], 'Art thou able to request\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthy Sustainer?'\" (Razi).

    "Body": " Most of the classical commentators regard this passage as a legal injunction, and interpret it, therefore, as follows: \"The recompense of those who make war on God and His apostle and spread corruption on earth shall but be that they shall be slain, or crucified, or that their hands and feet be cut off on opposite sides, or that they shall be banished from the earth: such shall be their ignominy in this world.\" This interpretation is, however, in no way warranted by the text, and this for the following reasons:  \r\\n \r\\n(a)\\tThe four passive verbs occurring in this sentence - \"slain\", \"crucified\", \"cut off\" and \"banished\" - are in the present tense and do not, by themselves, indicate the future or, alternatively, the imperative mood. \r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(b)\\tThe form yuqattalu does not signify simply \"they are being slain\" or (as the commentators would have it) \"they shall be slain\", but denotes - in accordance with a fundamental rule of Arabic grammar - \"they are being slain in great numbers\"; and the same holds true of the verbal forms yusallabu (\"they are being crucified in great numbers\") and yuqatta'a (\"cut off in great numbers\"). Now if we are to believe that these are \"ordained punishments\", it would imply that great numbers - but not necessarily all - of \"those who make war on God and His apostle\" should be punished in this way: obviously an inadmissible assumption of arbitrariness on the part of the Divine Law-Giver. Moreover, if the party \"waging war on God and His apostle\" should happen to consist of one person only, or of a few, how could a command referring to \"great numbers\" be applied to them or to him? \r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(c)\\tFurthermore, what would be the meaning of the phrase, \"they shall be banished from the earth\", if the above verse is to be taken as a legal injunction? This point has, indeed, perplexed the commentators considerably. Some of them assume that the transgressors should be \"banished from the land [of Islam]\": but there is no instance in the Qur'an of such a restricted use of the term \"earth\" (ard). Others, again, are of the opinion that the guilty ones should be imprisoned in a subterranean dungeon, which would constitute their \"banishment from [the face of] the earth\"!\r\\n \r\\n \r\\n(d) \\tFinally - and this is the weightiest objection to an interpretation of the above verse as a \"legal injunction\" - the Qur'an places exactly the same expressions referring to mass-crucifixion and mass-mutilation (but this time with a definite intent relating to the future) in the mouth of Pharaoh, as a threat to believers (see 7:124, 20:71 and 26:49). Since Pharaoh is invariably described in the Qur'an as the epitome of evil and godlessness, it is inconceivable that the same Qur'an would promulgate a divine law in precisely the terms which it attributes elsewhere to a figure characterized as an \"enemy of God\". \r\\n \r\\n \r\\nIn short, the attempt of the commentators to interpret the above verse as a \"legal injunction\" must be categorically rejected, however great the names of the persons responsible for it. On the other hand, a really convincing interpretation suggests itself to us at once as soon as we read the verse - as it ought to be read - in the present tense: for, read in this way, the verse reveals itself immediately as a statement of fact - a declaration of the inescapability of the retribution which \"those who make war on God\" bring upon themselves. Their hostility to ethical imperatives causes them to lose sight of all moral values; and their consequent mutual discord and \"perverseness\" gives rise to unending strife among themselves for the sake of worldly gain and power: they kill one another in great numbers, and torture and mutilate one another in great numbers, with the result that whole communities are wiped out or, as the Qur'an puts it, \"banished from [the face of] the earth\". It is this interpretation alone that takes full account of all the expressions occurring in this verse - the reference to \"great numbers\" in connection with deeds of extreme violence, the \"banishment from the earth\", and, lastly, the fact that these horrors are expressed in the terms used by Pharaoh, the \"enemy of God\".\r\\n "

    "Body": " The extreme severity of this Qur'anic punishment can be understood only if one bears in mind the fundamental principle of Islamic Law that no duty (taklif) is ever imposed on man without his being granted a corresponding right (haqq); and the term \"duty\" also comprises, in this context, liability to punishment. Now, among the inalienable rights of every member of the Islamic society - Muslim and non-Muslim alike - is the right to protection (in every sense of the word) by the community as a whole. As is evident from innumerable Qur'anic ordinances as well as the Prophet's injunctions forthcoming from authentic Traditions, every citizen is entitled to a share in the community's economic resources and, thus, to the enjoyment of social security: in other words, he or she must be assured of an equitable standard of living commensurate with the resources at the disposal of the community. For, although the Qur'an makes it clear that human life cannot be expressed in terms of physical existence alone - the ultimate values of life being spiritual in nature - the believers are not entitled to look upon spiritual truths and values as something that could be divorced from the physical and social factors of human existence. In short, Islam envisages and demands a society that provides not only for the spiritual needs of man, but for his bodily and intellectual needs as well. It follows, therefore, that - in order to be truly Islamic - a society (or state) must be so constituted that every individual, man and woman, may enjoy that minimum of material well-being and security without which there can be no human dignity, no real freedom and, in the last resort, no spiritual progress: for, there can be no real happiness and strength in a society that permits some of its members to suffer undeserved want while others have more than they need. If the whole society suffers privations owing to circumstances beyond its control (as happened, for instance, to the Muslim community in the early days of Islam), such shared privations may become a source of spiritual strength and, through it, of future greatness. But if the available resources of a community are so unevenly distributed that certain groups within it live in affluence while the majority of the people are forced to use up all their energies in search of their daily bread, poverty becomes the most dangerous enemy of spiritual progress, and occasionally drives whole communities away from God-consciousness and into the arms of soul-destroying materialism. It was undoubtedly this that the Prophet had in mind when he uttered the warning words (quoted by As-Suyuti in Al-Jami' as-Saghir), \"Poverty may well turn into a denial of the truth (kufr).\" Consequently, the social legislation of Islam aims at a state of affairs in which every man, woman and child has (a) enough to eat and wear, (b) an adequate home, (c) equal opportunities and facilities for education, and (d) free medical care in health and in sickness. A corollary of these rights is the right to productive and remunerative work while of working age and in good health, and a provision (by the community or the state) of adequate nourishment, shelter, etc. in cases of disability resulting from illness, widowhood, enforced unemployment, old age, or under-age. As already mentioned, the communal obligation to create such a comprehensive social security scheme has been laid down in many Qur'anic verses, and has been amplified and explained by a great number of the Prophet's commandments. It was the second Caliph, 'Umar ibn al-Khattab, who began to translate these ordinances into a concrete administrative scheme (see Ibn Sad, Tabaqat III/1, 213-217); but after his premature death, his successors had neither the vision nor the statesmanship to continue his unfinished work.  \r\\n\r\\n \r\\nIt is against the background of this social security scheme envisaged by Islam that the Qur'an imposes the severe sentence of hand-cutting as a deterrent punishment for robbery. Since, under the circumstances outlined above, \"temptation\" cannot be admitted as a justifiable excuse, and since, in the last resort, the entire socio-economic system of Islam is based on the faith of its adherents, its balance is extremely delicate and in need of constant, strictly-enforced protection. In a community in which everyone is assured of full security and social justice, any attempt on the part of an individual to achieve an easy, unjustified gain at the expense of other members of the community must be considered an attack against the system as a whole, and must be punished as such: and, therefore, the above ordinance which lays down that the hand of the thief shall be cut off. One must, however, always bear in mind the principle mentioned at the beginning of this note: namely, the absolute interdependence between man's rights and corresponding duties (including liability to punishment). In a community or state which neglects or is unable to provide complete social security for all its members, the temptation to enrich oneself by illegal means often becomes irresistible - and, consequently, theft cannot and should not be punished as severely as it should be punished in a state in which social security is a reality in the full sense of the word. If the society is unable to fulfil its duties with regard to every one of its members, it has no right to invoke the full sanction of criminal law (hadd) against the individual transgressor, but must confine itself to milder forms of administrative punishment. (It was in correct appreciation of this principle that the great Caliph 'Umar waived the hadd of hand-cutting in a period of famine which afflicted Arabia during his reign.) To sum up, one may safely conclude that the cutting-off of a hand in punishment for theft is applicable only within the context of an already-existing, fully functioning social security scheme, and in no other circumstances. \r\\n"

The classical commentators adopt, as a rule, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst sense and, consequently, interpret the passage\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthus: \"...the two angels that are charged with recording\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tman's doings do record them, sitting on his right and on\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this left\". In my opinion, however, the second of the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossible meanings (\"the two that aim at meeting each\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother\") corresponds better with the preceding verse,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich speaks of what man's innermost self (nafs)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"whispers within him\", i.e., voices his subconscious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdesires. Thus, \"the two that aim at meeting\" are, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelieve, the two demands of, or, more properly, the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfundamental motive forces within man's nature: his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprimal, instinctive urges and desires, both sensual and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-sensual (all of them comprised in the modern\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpsychological term \"libido\"), on the one side, and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treason, both intuitive and reflective, on the other.

As described in a number of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treports going back to some Companions, the moon appeared\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tone night as if split into two distinct parts. While\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no reason to doubt the subjective veracity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthese reports, it is possible that what actually happened\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas an unusual kind of partial lunar eclipse, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tproduced an equally unusual optical illusion. But\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhatever the nature of that phenomenon, it is practically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertain that the above Qur'an-verse does not refer to it\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut, rather, to a future event: namely, to what will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappen when the Last Hour approaches. (The Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrequently employs the past tense to denote the future,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand particularly so in passages which speak of the coming\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Last Hour and of Resurrection Day; this use of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpast tense is meant to stress the certainty of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thappening to which the verb relates.) Thus, Raghib\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tregards it as fully justifiable to interpret the phrase\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinshaqqa 'l-qamar (\"the moon is split asunder\") as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbearing on the cosmic cataclysm - the end of the world as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twe know it - that will occur before the coming of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tResurrection Day (see art. shaqq in the  Mufradat). As\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmentioned by Zamakhshari, this interpretation has the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupport of some of the earlier commentators; and it is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto my mind, particularly convincing in view of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjuxtaposition, in the above Qur'an-verse, of the moon's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"splitting asunder\" and the approach of the Last Hour.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(In this connection we must bear in mind the fact that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnone of the Qur'anic allusions to the \"nearness\" of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLast Hour and the Day of Resurrection is based on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman concept of \"time\".)"

It is to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twarn man of this danger that the Qur'an stresses -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsymbolically and metonymically - the potential evil\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ba's) of \"iron\" if it is put to wrong use: in other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, the danger of man's allowing his technological\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tingenuity to run wild and thus to overwhelm his spiritual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsciousness and, ultimately, to destroy all possibility\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof individual and social happiness."

Inasmuch as every such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrouping is characterized by the basic fact that its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconstituents (whether human or animal) are endowed with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife, the term ummah sometimes signifies \"[God's]\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreatures\" (Lisan al-'Arab, with particular reference to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis very Qur'an-verse; also Lane I, 90). Thus, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeaning of the above passage is this: Man can detect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod's \"signs\" or \"miracles\" in all the life-phenomena\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat surround him, and should, therefore, try to observe\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem with a view to better understanding \"God's way\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(sunnat Allah) - which is the Qur'anic term for what we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcall \"laws of nature\"."

Since,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin its primary significance, a person's ma'shar denotes\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthose who are on intimate terms or in close communion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith him (cf. Lisan al-'Arab: \"A man's ma'shar is his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfamily\"), we may well assume that it has a similar\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignificance in the above Qur'anic phrase. Thus, to my\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind, the allocution ya ma'shar al-jinn does not denote,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O you community of [evil] invisible beings\" but, rather,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"O you who are [or \"have lived\"] in close communion with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[evil] invisible beings\": in other words, it is addressed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the misguided human beings who have been seduced by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"glittering half-truths meant to delude the mind\" {verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t112}. This interpretation is reinforced by the words,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"Have there not come unto you apostles from among\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyourselves\", occurring in verse {130} below: for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an speaks always only of apostles who belonged to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thuman race, and never of apostles from among the jinn.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(As regards the wide significance of this latter term,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsee Appendix III.)"

The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraysh took this stipulation to include also married\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twomen, whom they considered to be under the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"guardianship\" of their husbands. Accordingly, when\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral Meccan women embraced Islam against the will of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir husbands and fled to Medina, the Quraysh demanded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir forcible return to Mecca. This the Prophet refused\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the grounds that married women did not fall within the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategory of \"persons under guardianship\". However, since\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere was always the possibility that some of these women\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad gone over to the Muslims not for reasons of faith but\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout of purely worldly considerations, the believers were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoined to make sure of their sincerity; and so, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet asked each of them: \"Swear before God that thou\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdidst not leave because of hatred of thy husband, or out\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a desire to go to another country, or in the hope of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattaining to worldly advantages: swear before God that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthou didst not leave for any reason save the love of God\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand His Apostle\" (Tabari). Since God alone knows what is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin the heart of a human being, a positive response of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twoman concerned was to be regarded as the only humanly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tattainable - and, therefore, legally sufficient - proof\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof her sincerity. The fact that God alone is really aware\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof what is in a human being's heart is incorporated in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe shar'i principle that any adult person's declaration\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof faith, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmakes it mandatory upon the community to accept that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson - whether man or woman - as a Muslim on the basis\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this declaration alone."

The fact that the earliest followers\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Jesus regarded him as purely human is evident from the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany theological controversies which persisted during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfirst three or four centuries of the Christian era. Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsome renowned theologians, like Theodotus of Byzantium,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho lived towards the end of the second century, and his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowers - among them Paul of Samosata, Bishop of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAntioch in the year 260 - maintained that the \"sonship of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod\" mentioned in the then-existing texts of the Gospels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas purely symbolic, denoting no more than that Jesus was\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta human being exalted by God. The originally widespread\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tteachings of Bishop Arius (280-326) centred in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconcept of Jesus as a mortal man chosen by God for a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspecific task, and in the concept of God as absolutely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tOne, unknowable, and separate from every created being;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis doctrine, however, was ultimately condemned by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCouncils of Nicaea (325) and Constantinople (381), and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgradually ceased to have any influence on the Christian\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmasses."

They had been entrusted by God with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe task of carrying the message of His oneness and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuniqueness to all the world: but they failed in this task\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinasmuch as they came to believe that they were \"God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tchosen people\" because of their descent from Abraham,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIsaac and Jacob, and that, therefore, the divine message\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas meant for them alone and not for people of other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnations.

In his earlier\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate of innocence man was unaware of the existence of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevil and, therefore, of the ever-present necessity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmaking a choice between the many possibilities of action\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand behaviour: in other words, he lived, like all other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tanimals, in the light of his instincts alone. Inasmuch,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, as this innocence was only a condition of his\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texistence and not a virtue, it gave to his life a static\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquality and thus precluded him from moral and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tintellectual development The growth of his consciousness\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- symbolized by the wilful act of disobedience to God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommand - changed all this. It transformed him from a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurely instinctive being into a full-fledged human entity\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas we know it - a human being capable of discerning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbetween right and wrong and thus of choosing his way of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlife. In this deeper sense, the allegory of the Fall does\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot describe a retrogressive happening but, rather, a new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstage of human development: an opening of doors to moral\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsiderations. By forbidding him to \"approach this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttree\", God made it possible for man to act wrongly - and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, to act rightly as well: and so man became\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tendowed with that moral free will which distinguishes him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom all other sentient beings. - Regarding the role of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tSatan - or Iblis - as the eternal tempter of man, see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnote [26] on  2:34  and note [31] on  15:41 ."

As for the word jamal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurring in this sentence, there is hardly any doubt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat its translation, in this context, as \"camel\" is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\terroneous. As pointed out by Zamakhshari (and confirmed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby other classical commentators, including Razi), Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas used to read the word in the spelling jummal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich signifies \"a thick rope\" or \"a twisted cable\"; and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe same reading is attributed to 'Ali ibn Abi Talib (Taj\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-'Arus). It is to be noted that there are also several\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother dialectical spellings of this word, namely, jumal,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjuml, jumul and, finally, jamal (as in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgenerally-accepted version of the Qur'an) - all of them\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifying \"a thick, twisted rope\" (Jawhari), and all of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem used in this sense by some of the Prophet's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tCompanions or their immediate successors (tabi'un). Ibn\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Abbas is also quoted by Zamakhshari as having said that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tGod could not have coined so inappropriate a metaphor as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"a camel passing through a needle's eye\" - meaning that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere is no relationship whatsoever between a camel and a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tneedle's eye whereas, on the other hand, there is a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinite relationship between the latter and a rope\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(which after all, is but an extremely thick thread). On\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall accounts, therefore, the rendering of jamal as \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttwisted rope\" is, in this context, infinitely preferable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto that of \"a camel\". The fact that the latter rendering\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toccurs in a somewhat similar phrase in the Greek version\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the Synoptic Gospels (Matthew xix, 24, Mark x, 25 and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke xviii, 25) does not affect this contention. One\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tshould remember that the Gospels were originally composed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin Aramaic, the language of Palestine at the time of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tJesus, and that those Aramaic texts are now lost. It is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmore than probable that, owing to the customary absence\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof vowel signs in Aramaic writing, the Greek translator\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmisunderstood the consonant spelling g-m-l (corresponding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the Arabic j-m-l), and took it to mean \"a camel\": a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmistake repeated since, with regard to the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'an-verse, by many Muslims and all non-Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torientalists as well."

It is the plural of 'urf, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprimarily denotes \"acknowledgement\" or \"discernment\", and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis also used to denote the highest, or most elevated,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of anything (because it is most easily discerned):\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfor instance, the 'urf of a cock is the coxcomb, that of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta horse its mane, and so forth. On the basis of this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tidiomatic usage, many commentators assume that the a'raf\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treferred to here are \"elevated places\", like the heights\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof a wall or its ramparts, and identify it with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"barrier\" (hijab) mentioned at the end of the preceding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence. A far more likely interpretation, however, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tforthcoming from the primary significance of the word\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'urf and its plural a'raf: namely, \"discernment\" and \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfaculty of discernment\", respectively. This\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation has been adopted by some of the great,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly commentators of the Qur'an, like Al-Hasan al-Basri\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand Az-Zajjaj, whose views Razi quotes with evident\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapproval. They state emphatically that the expression\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'ala 'l-a'raf is synonymous with 'ala ma'rifah, that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"possessing knowledge\" or \"endowed with the faculty of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdiscernment\" (i.e., between right and wrong), and that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe persons thus described are those who in their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlifetime were able to discern between right and wrong\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"recognizing each by its mark\"), but did not definitely\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tincline to either: in brief, the indifferent ones. Their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlukewarm attitude has prevented them from doing either\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch good or much wrong - with the result that, as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnext sentence shows, they deserve neither paradise nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thell.

As pointed out there, the jinn are referred\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto in the Qur'an in many connotations. In a few cases -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\te.g., in the present instance and in {46:29-32} - this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression may possibly signify \"hitherto unseen beings\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnamely, strangers who had never before been seen by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpeople among and to whom the Qur'an was then being\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed. From  46:30  (which evidently relates to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame occurrence as the present one) it transpires that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe jinn in question were followers of the Mosaic faith,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinasmuch as they refer to the Qur'an as \"a revelation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbestowed from on high after [that of] Moses\", thus\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpointedly omitting any mention of the intervening\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprophet, Jesus, and equally pointedly (in verse {3} of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe present surah) stressing their rejection of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tChristian concept of the Trinity. All this leads one to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe assumption that they may have been Jews from distant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparts of what is now the Arab world, perhaps from Syria\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tor even Mesopotamia.

This meaning is easily\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tgrasped when we bear in mind that the root verb of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticipial noun kafir (and of the infinitive noun kufr)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tis kafara, \"he [or \"it\"] covered [a thing]\": thus, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t 57:20  the tiller of the soil is called (without any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpejorative implication) kafir, \"one who covers\", i.e.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sown seed with earth, just as the night is spoken of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas having \"covered\" (kafara) the earth with darkness. In\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir abstract sense, both the verb and the nouns derived\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom it have a connotation of \"concealing\" something that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texists or \"denying\" something that is true. Hence, in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tusage of the Qur'an - with the exception of the one\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinstance (in  57:20 ) where this participial noun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsignifies a \"tiller of the soil\" - a kafir is \"one who\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdenies [or \"refuses to acknowledge\"] the truth\" in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twidest, spiritual sense of this latter term: that is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tirrespective of whether it relates to a cognition of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsupreme truth - namely, the existence of God - or to a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoctrine or ordinance enunciated in the divine writ, or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto a self-evident moral proposition, or to an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tacknowledgment of, and therefore gratitude for, favours\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treceived.

As regards my rendering of kawa'ib as \"splendid\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcompanions\", it is to be remembered that the term ka'b -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom which the participle ka'ib is derived - has many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeanings, and that one of these meanings is \"prominence\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"eminence\" or \"glory\" (Lisan al-'Arab); thus, the verb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'ba, when applied to a person, signifies \"he made\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[another person] prominent\", \"glorious\" or \"splendid\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(ibid.) Based on this tropical meaning of both the verb\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'ba and the noun ka'b, the participle ka'ib has often\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen used, in popular parlance, to denote \"a girl whose\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbreasts are becoming prominent\" or \"are budding\": hence,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmany commentators see in it an allusion to some sort of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyouthful \"female companions\" who would entertain the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(presumably male) inmates of paradise. But quite apart\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom the fact that all Qur'anic allegories of the joys of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparadise invariably apply to men and women alike, this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation of kawa'ib overlooks the purely derivative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torigin of the above popular usage - which is based on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttropical connotation of \"prominence\" inherent in the noun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tka'b - and substitutes for this obvious tropism the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tliteral meaning of something that is physically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprominent: and this, in my opinion, is utterly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunjustified. If we bear in mind that the Qur'anic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdescriptions of the blessings of paradise are always\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallegorical, we realize that in the above context the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tterm kawa'ib can have no other meaning than \"glorious [or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"splendid\"] beings\", without any definition of sex; and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat, in combination with the term atrab, it denotes,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"splendid companions well-matched\" - thus alluding to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelations of the blest with one another, and stressing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe absolute mutual compatibility and equal dignity of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall of them.

The most popular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation is based on the view that the descriptive\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticiples an-nazi'at, an-nashitat, as-sabihat,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas-sabiqat and al-mudabbirat refer to angels and their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tactivities with regard to the souls of the dying: an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretation categorically rejected by Abu Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Isfahani, who - as mentioned by Razi - points out that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe angels are never referred to in the Qur'an in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfemale gender, as is the case in the above five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticiples, and that the present passage cannot be an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texception. Almost equally unconvincing - because somewhat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlaboured - are the explanations which link those five\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticiples to the souls of the dying, or to warriors\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tengaged in holy war, or to war-mounts, and so forth. The\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclearest and simplest interpretation is that advanced by\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQatadah (as quoted by Tabari and Baghawi) and Al-Hasan\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-Basri (quoted by Baghawi and Razi), who maintain that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat is meant in this passage are the stars - including\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe sun and the moon - and their movements in space: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis interpretation is fully in tune with many other\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassages in the Qur'an in which the harmony of those\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcelestial bodies in their multiform orbits and graded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeeds is cited as an evidence of God's planning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcreativeness. In accordance with this interpretation, the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticiple an-nazi'at occurring in the first verse\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdenotes the daily \"ascending\" or \"rising\" of the stars,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhile their subsequent \"setting\" is indicated by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression gharqan, which comprises the two concepts of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"drowning,\" (i.e., disappearing) and, tropically, of the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"completeness\" of this daily phenomenon (Zamakhshari)."

And if you abstain [from making war\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton God and His Apostle], it will be for your own good;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbut if you revert to it, We shall revert [to defeating\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyou] - and never will your army be of any avail to you,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever great its numbers: for, behold, God is with the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers!\" As can be seen from this alternative\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trendering, the difference in interpretation pivots on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttropical meaning which one gives to the words fath\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"decision\" or \"victory\") and fi'ah (\"army\" or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"community\"). As regards the latter, it is to be borne in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmind that its primary significance is \"a group\" or \"a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcongregated body of men\" - more or less synonymous with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tta'ifah or jama'ah; it can, therefore, be used to denote\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"an army\" as well as \"a community\".

(For the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tuse of the verb 'ada in the sense of \"he revoked\", see\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTaj al-'Arus; also Lane V, 2189.) But while both\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinterpretations of the above verse are linguistically\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjustified, the one adopted by me (and supported,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccording to Ibn Kathir, by Ubayy ibn Ka'b) is in greater\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tharmony with the context, inasmuch as both the preceding\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand subsequent passages are unmistakably addressed to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers. Thus, the verse must be understood as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treminder to the Muslims that God will be with them only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tso long as they remain firm in faith and righteous in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taction, and that, however large their community may be in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe future, they will be powerless unless they are true\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers."

According to these commentators, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove sentence abolished the custom which was prevalent\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tamong the early Muslims, whereby the ansar (\"the helpers\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- i.e., the newly-converted Muslims of Medina) concluded,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tindividually, symbolic ties of brotherhood with the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuhajirin (\"the emigrants\" from Mecca), who, almost\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twithout exception, arrived at Medina in a state of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomplete destitution: ties of brotherhood, that is, which\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tentitled every muhajir to a share in the property of his\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"brother\" from among the ansar, and, in the event of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlatter's death, to a share in the inheritance left by\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim. The above verse is said to have prohibited such\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tarrangements by stipulating that only actual close\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelations should henceforth have a claim to inheritance.\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTo my mind, however, this interpretation is not\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconvincing. Although the expression ulu 'l-arham is\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tderived from the noun rahm (also spelt rihm and rahim),\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich literally signifies \"womb\", one should not forget\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat it is tropically used in the sense of \"kinship\",\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"relationship\" or \"close relationship\" in general (i.e.,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnot merely blood-relationship). Thus, \"in the classical\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlanguage, ulu 'l-arham means any relations: and in law,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tany relations that have no portion [of the inheritances\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttermed fara'id]\" (Lane III, 1056, citing, among other\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tauthorities, the Taj al-'Arus). In the present instance,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe reference to \"close relations\" comes at the end of a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpassage which centres on the injunction that the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbelievers must be \"the friends and protectors (awliya')\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof one another\", and that all later believers shall,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilarly, be regarded as members of the Islamic\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrotherhood. If the reference to \"close relations\" were\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmeant to be taken in its literal sense and conceived as\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\talluding to laws of inheritance, it would be quite out of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttune with the rest of the passage, which stresses the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbonds of faith among true believers, as well as the moral\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tobligations arising from these bonds. In my opinion,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, the above verse has no bearing on laws of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinheritance, but is meant to summarize, as it were, the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlesson of the preceding verses: All true believers, of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall times, form one single community in the deepest sense\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof this word; and all who are thus closely related in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspirit have the highest claim on one another in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccordance with God's decree that \"all believers are\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbrethren\" ( 49:10 )."

Now if we analyze\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe origin of this noun, we find that it is derived from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe verb taraqa, which primarily means \"he beat\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[something]\" or \"knocked [at something]\"; hence, taraqa\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'l-bab, \"he knocked at the door\".

This last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tclause has ever since given much trouble to the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommentators, inasmuch as it is not very plausible that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHe who has revealed the Qur'an to the Prophet should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause him to forget anything of it. Hence, many\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunconvincing explanations have been advanced from very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tearly times down to our own days, the least convincing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeing that last refuge of every perplexed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuran-commentator, the \"doctrine of abrogation\" (refuted\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin my note [87] on  2:106 ). However, the supposed\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifficulty of interpretation disappears as soon as we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tallow ourselves to realize that the above passage, though\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tostensibly addressed to the Prophet, is directed at man\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin general, and that it is closely related to an earlier\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuranic revelation - namely, the first five verses of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurah {96} (\"The Germ-Cell\") and, in particular, verses\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t{3-5}, which speak of God's having \"taught man what he\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid not know\". In note [3] on those verses I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpressed the opinion that they allude to mankind's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcumulative acquisition of empirical and rational\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tknowledge, handed down from generation to generation and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfrom one civilization to another: and it is to this very\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tphenomenon that the present passage, too, refers. We are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttold here that God, who has formed man in accordance with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat he is meant to be and has promised to guide him,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twill enable him to acquire (and thus, as it were,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"impart\" to him) elements of knowledge which mankind will\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccumulate, record and collectively \"remember\" - except\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhat God may cause man to \"forget\" (in another word, to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabandon) as having become redundant by virtue of his new\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texperiences and his acquisition of wider, more\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdifferentiated elements of knowledge, empirical as well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas deductive or speculative, including more advanced,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tempirically acquired skills. However, the very next\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence makes it clear that all knowledge arrived at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthrough our observation of the external world and through\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tspeculation, though necessary and most valuable, is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefinitely limited in scope and does not, therefore, in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\titself suffice to give us an insight into ultimate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttruths."

Most of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem assume that it refers to the pilgrimage in the year\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t9 H., in which the Prophet himself did not participate,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thaving entrusted Abu Bakr with the office of amir\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tal-hajj. This very fact, however, makes it improbable\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the designation \"the Greatest Pilgrimage\" should\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave been given in the Qur'an to this particular\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage. On the other hand, there exists a Tradition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ton the authority of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar to the effect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat the Prophet described in these very words the last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpilgrimage led by himself in 10 H. and known to history\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tas the Farewell Pilgrimage (Zamakhshari, Razi); one may,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttherefore, assume that it is this which is alluded to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\there. If this assumption is correct, it would justify the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconclusion that verses {3} and {4} of this surah were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trevealed during the Farewell Pilgrimage, i.e., shortly\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbefore the Prophet's death. This might explain the -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\totherwise perplexing - statement, reliably attributed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet's Companion Al-Bara' (Bukhari, Kitab\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tat-Tafsir), that At-Tawbah was the last surah revealed to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Prophet: for, although it is established beyond any\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdoubt that the surah as a whole was revealed in 9 H. and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twas followed by several other parts of the Qur'an, e.g.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAl-Ma'idah, it is possible that what Al-Bara' had in mind\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twere only these two key-verses ({3} and {4}) of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAt-Tawbah, which conceivably were revealed during the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tFarewell Pilgrimage."

    "Body": "As I have pointed out on more than one occasion, every\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse of the Qur'an must be read and interpreted against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe background of the Qur'an as a whole. The above verse,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich speaks of a possible conversion to Islam on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpart of \"those who ascribe divinity to aught beside God\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith whom the believers are at war, must, therefore, be\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsidered in conjunction with several fundamental\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQur'anic ordinances. One of them, \"There shall be no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcoercion in matters of faith\" ( 2:256 ), lays down\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcategorically that any attempt at a forcible conversion\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof unbelievers is prohibited - which precludes the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpossibility of the Muslims' demanding or expecting that a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdefeated enemy should embrace Islam as the price of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\timmunity. Secondly, the Qur'an ordains, \"Fight in God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause against those who wage war against you; but do not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommit aggression, for verily, God does not love\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taggressors\" ( 2:190 ); and, \"if they do not let you be,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand do not offer you peace, and do not stay their hands,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tseize them and slay them whenever you come upon them: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is against these that We have clearly empowered you\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t[to make war]\" ( 4:91 ). Thus, war is permissible only in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tself-defence (see surah {2}, notes [167] and [168]), with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe further proviso that \"if they desist - behold, God is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmuch-forgiving, a dispenser of grace\" ( 2:192 ), and \"if\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey desist, then all hostility shall cease\" ( 2:193 ).\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tNow the enemy's conversion to Islam - expressed in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twords, \"if they repent, and take to prayer [lit.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"establish prayer\"] and render the purifying dues\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(zakah)\" - is no more than one, and by no means the only,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tway of their \"desisting from hostility\"; and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treference to it in verses {5} and {11} of this surah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcertainly does not imply an alternative of \"conversion or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdeath\", as some unfriendly critics of Islam choose to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tassume. Verses {4} and {6} give a further elucidation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe attitude which the believers are enjoined to adopt\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttowards such of the unbelievers as are not hostile to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthem.

Since, earlier in this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsentence, the people alluded to are accused of so grave a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsin as wilfully refusing to believe in God and the Last\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDay (i.e., in life after death and man's individual\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tresponsibility for his doings on earth), it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinconceivable that they should subsequently be blamed for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcomparatively minor offences against their religious law:\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tconsequently, the stress on their \"not forbidding that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich God and His apostle have forbidden\" must refer to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething which is as grave, or almost as grave, as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdisbelief in God.

    "Body": "Sc., \"and having become incorporated in the Islamic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstate\". The term jizyah, rendered by me as \"exemption\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttax\", occurs in the Qur'an only once, but its meaning and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpurpose have been fully explained in many authentic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tTraditions. It is intimately bound up with the concept of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Islamic state as an ideological organization: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is a point which must always be borne in mind if the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treal purport of this tax is to be understood. In the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIslamic state, every able-bodied Muslim is obliged to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttake up arms in jihad (i.e., in a just war in God's\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcause) whenever the freedom of his faith or the political\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsafety of his community is imperilled: in other words,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevery able-bodied Muslim is liable to compulsory military\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice. Since this is, primarily, a religious obligation\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-Muslim citizens, who do not subscribe to the ideology\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof Islam, cannot in fairness be expected to assume a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsimilar burden. On the other hand, they must be accorded\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull protection of all their civic rights and of their\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligious freedom: and it is in order to compensate the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslim community for this unequal distribution of civic\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tburdens that a special tax is levied on non-Muslim\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcitizens (ahl adh-dhimmah, lit., \"covenanted\" [or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"protected\"] people\", i.e., non-Muslims whose safety is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tstatutorily assured by the Muslim community). Thus,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjizyah is no more and no less than an exemption tax in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tlieu of military service and in compensation for the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"covenant of protection\" (dhimmah) accorded to such\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcitizens by the Islamic state. (The term itself is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tderived from the verb jaza \"he rendered [something] as a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsatisfaction\", or \"as a compensation [in lieu of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsomething else;\" - cf. Lane II, 422.) No fixed rate has\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbeen set either by the Qur'an or by the Prophet for this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttax; but from all available Traditions it is evident that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tit is to be considerably lower than the tax called zakah\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"the purifying dues\") to which Muslims are liable and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twhich - because it is a specifically Islamic religious\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tduty - is naturally not to be levied on non-Muslims. Only\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsuch of the non-Muslim citizens who, if they were\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMuslims, would be expected to serve in the armed forces\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof the state are liable to the payment of jizyah,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tprovided that they can easily afford it. Accordingly, all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnon-Muslim citizens whose personal status or condition\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twould automatically free them from the obligation to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trender military service are statutorily - that is, on the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tbasis of clear-cut ordinances promulgated by the Prophet\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t- exempted from the payment of jizyah: (a) all women, (b)\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmales who have not yet reached full maturity, (c) old\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmen, (d) all sick or crippled men, (e) priests and monks.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAll non-Muslim citizens who volunteer for military\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tservice are obviously exempted from the payment of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tjizyah. My rendering of the expression 'an yad (lit.,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"out of hand\") as \"with a willing hand\", that is, without\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treluctance, is based on one of several explanations\\n\\t\\t\\t\\toffered by Zamakhshari in his commentary on the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse. Rashid Rida', taking the word yad in its\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmetaphorical significance of \"power\" or \"ability\",\\n\\t\\t\\t\\trelates the phrase 'an yad to the financial ability of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe person liable to the payment of jizyah (see Manar X,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t342): an interpretation which is undoubtedly justified in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tview of the accepted definition of this tax."

As regards the belief attributed to the Jews\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat Ezra (or, in the Arabicized form of this name\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t'Uzayr) was \"God's son\", it is to be noted that almost\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tall classical commentators of the Qur'an agree in that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly the Jews of Arabia, and not all Jews, have been thus\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\taccused. (According to a Tradition on the authority of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tIbn 'Abbas - quoted by Tabari in his commentary on this\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tverse - some of the Jews of Medina once said to Muhammad,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"How could we follow thee when thou hast forsaken our\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tqiblah and dost not consider Ezra a son of God?\") On the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tother hand, Ezra occupies a unique position in the esteem\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof all Jews, and has always been praised by them in the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmost extravagant terms. It was he who restored and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcodified the Torah after it had been lost during the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tBabylonian Exile, and \"edited\" it in more or less the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tform which it has today, and thus \"he promoted the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\testablishment of an exclusive, legalistic type of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treligion that became dominant in later Judaism\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1963, vol.

Ever\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsince then he has been venerated to such a degree that\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\this verdicts on the Law of Moses have come to be regarded\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tby the Talmudists as being practically equivalent to the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLaw itself: which, in Qur'anic ideology, amounts to the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tunforgivable sin of shirk, inasmuch as it implies the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\televation of a human being to the status of a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tquasi-divine law-giver and the blasphemous attribution to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thim - albeit metaphorically - of the quality of \"sonship\"\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tin relation to God. Cf. in this connection Exodus iv,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t22-23 (\"Israel is My son\") or Jeremiah xxxi, 9 (\"I am a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfather to Israel\"): expressions to which, because of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ttheir idolatrous implications, the Qur'an takes strong\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texception."

The\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thistorical occasion to which this verse refers may be\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthus summarized: Ever since his exodus from Mecca to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMedina the Prophet was violently opposed by one Abu 'Amir\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(\"The Monk\"), a prominent member of the Khazraj tribe,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twho had embraced Christianity many years earlier and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tenjoyed a considerable reputation among his compatriots\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand among the Christians of Syria. From the very outset\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\the allied himself with the Prophet's enemies, the Meccan\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuraysh, and took part on their side in the battle of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tUhud (3 H.). Shortly thereafter he migrated to Syria and\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid all that he could to induce the Emperor of Byzantium,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tHeraclius, to invade Medina and crush the Muslim\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcommunity once and for all. In Medina itself, Abu 'Amir\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thad some secret followers among the members of his tribe,\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twith whom he remained in constant correspondence. In the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tyear 9 H. he informed them that Heraclius had agreed to\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsend out an army against Medina, and that large-scale\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpreparations were being made to this effect (which was\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tapparently the reason for the Prophet's preventive\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition to Tabuk). In order that his followers should\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thave a rallying-place in the event of the expected\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tinvasion of Medina, Abu 'Amir suggested to his friends\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthat they build a mosque of their own in the village of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tQuba', in the immediate vicinity of Medina (which they\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid), and thus obviate the necessity of congregating in\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe mosque which the Prophet himself had built in the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsame village at the time of his arrival at Medina (see\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tnote [145] below). It is this \"rival\" mosque to which the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabove verse refers. It was demolished at the Prophet's\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\torders immediately after his return from the Tabuk\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpedition. Abu 'Amir himself died in Syria shortly\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tafterwards.

This Qur'anic principle has been\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\temphasized in many well-authenticated sayings of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tProphet, for instance, \"Striving after knowledge is a\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsacred duty (faridah) for every man and woman who has\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tsurrendered himself or herself to God (muslim\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twa-muslimah)\" (Ibn Majah); or, \"The superiority (fadl) of\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ta learned man over a [mere] worshipper [i.e., one who\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmerely prays, fasts, etc.] is like the superiority of the\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfull moon over all the stars\" (Tirmidhi, Abu Da'ud, Ibn\r\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tMajah, Ibn Hanbal, Darimi).

It is generally assumed that this\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tparticiple, in combination with the phrase lam yakun at\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe beginning of the verse, denotes \"they did not [or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"could not\"] give up\" or \"separate themselves from\" -\\n\\t\\t\\t\\ti.e., supposedly, from their erroneous beliefs - \"until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthere came to them the evidence of the truth\" in the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tperson of the Prophet Muhammad and in the revelation of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an: implying that after the evidence came, they\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tdid give up those false beliefs. This assumption is,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\thowever, deficient on two counts: firstly, it is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell-known that not all of the erring ones from among the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tahl al-kitab and the mushrikin accepted the message of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe Qur'an when it was conveyed to them; and, secondly,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe ahl al-kitab are spoken of in verse {4} as having\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"broken their unity [of faith]\" - i.e., offended against\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe fundamental principles of that faith - after \"the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence of the truth\" had come to them. This apparent\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tcontradiction has been convincingly resolved by no less\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tan authority than Ibn Taymiyyah (see Tafsir Sitt Suwar,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tpp. 391 ff.); and it is his interpretation that I have\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tfollowed in my rendering of the above three verses.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAccording to Ibn Taymiyyah, the pivotal phrase lam yakun\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmunfakkin does not denote \"they did not give up\" or\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"separate themselves from\", but, rather, \"they are not\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tabandoned\" - i.e., condemned by God - unless and until\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthey have been shown the right way by a God-sent prophet,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand thereupon have consciously refused to follow it: and\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthis is in accord with repeated statements in the Qur'an\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tto the effect that God does not take anyone to task for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twrong beliefs and wrong actions unless the true meaning\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tof right and wrong has previously been made clear to him\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t(cf. {6:131-132} and the second paragraph of  17:15 , as\\n\\t\\t\\t\\twell as the corresponding notes). Hence, the above\\n\\t\\t\\t\\treference to \"the evidence of the truth\" does not relate\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tonly to the Qur'an and the Prophet Muhammad but to all\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tthe earlier prophets and revelations as well (cf.  42:13 \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tand the corresponding notes [12-14]- just as the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\"ordinances of ever-true soundness and clarity\" (spelled\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tout in verse {5} below) are common to all God-inspired\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tmessages, of which the Qur'an is the final, most perfect\\n\\t\\t\\t\\texpression."
